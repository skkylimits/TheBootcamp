# Tweeting

Now we're going to start Tweeting.

But we're not going to tweet ourselves, instead we're going to use Tate's Tweets.

In your TOOLS section, you will see a channel called:
ðŸ’Œï¸±messages-of-zion.

This channel consists of a growing library of Tate tweets that we copy and paste on our account.

At the bottom of the Tweet it says "- Andrew Tate", you can either change this part to "Cobra", or leave this part away.

When a zion message is too long for a Tweet, you can either cut it in half and use the second half as a reply to the original Tweet or you skip this message; most messages are Tweet length though.

(Video on how to handle this at the bottom)

You can also write your own Tweets, but I recommend you just use the Tate cheatcode here and don't spend your time on coming up with own Tweets.

How often to post?

Post 2 Zion message for every video.

Try to space them out with 10 minutes.

Meaning, you post one video and wait at least 10 minutes before you Tweet.

## Twitter Attack
Until now you guys were only re-posting your videos on Twitter.
