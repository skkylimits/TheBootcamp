- 1 generic (e.g. motivation)
- 1 generic (e.g. mindset)
- 1 specific (e.g. motivatinmindset)
or
- #shorts
- 1 generic (e.g. motivation)
- 1 specific (e.g. motivationmindset)
or
- 1 generic (e.g. motivation)
- 1 specific (e.g. motivationmindset)
- 1 specific (e.g. motivationalvideo)

Also, use the generic and specific ones here only if applicable to your content.

If you struggle with low views, you can use these strategies.

If you start to get views by using a hashtags, keep using them.

If not, I'd switch between hashtags and no hashtags every 3-4 days.

E.g.
- 3 days with hashtags
- 3 days with no hashtags

And on YouTube, leverage keywords like 'Millionaire' or 'Mindset' in your Title. It can help YouTube in finding your target audience as well.
