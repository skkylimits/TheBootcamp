# Pinned Comments

YouTube is the only App where you can currently pin your own comments to the top of the comment section.

This allows us to do comment fishing on a much greater scale than on Instagram, TikTok or Twitter.

But YouTube also doesn't have a small character limit like Instagram or TikTok has it, and you can also format text with paragraphs etc.

This allows us to play the YouTube comments game on much bigger scale as a whole.

Therefore we can do a 3 things in our comment section on YouTube:
- Comment fish with questions
- Give value with Zion Messages
- Give value with Tate Emails

Yes, we want to take advantage of Zion Messages and Tate Emails.

It's important that not all our comments are questions and meant to make people comment. If we do that on EVERY video, out viewers will feel used.

We also want to just give them pure value by posting a comment that's either a Zion Message or a Tate Email.

You can find emails and Zion messages in the tools section.

It's best if you can pick a message/email that's related to the topic of the video.

And we want to keep a ratio of around 1:3 when it comes to posting value instead of questions.

If you post 3 videos a day, you should have at least 1 video where you made a 'value comment'.

If you post 6 video a day, you should have at least 2 videos where you made 'value comments'.

I'm saying 'at least' because I rather give people too much value, then give them too little.
