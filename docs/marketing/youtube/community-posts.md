# Community Posts

This is a tool you unlock after 500 followers and it can then take up to a week until they are unlocked.

We will cover ways to use this tool in extension later as most of you aren't there yet, but as an outlook:

This tool allows you post images, messages and make pools.

It is AMAZING to engage your audience with your channel, and if you play it right, you can also go viral with such a Community post.

If you are familiar with YouTube and you ever had polls on your discovery page, those were community posts.

If you have already unlocked them, I recommend to post:
- 1 Tate email with a picture daily
- 2 Zion messages without pictures daily
- 1 Meme every 2-3 days
- Make a poll about a controversial topic when applicable (Cobra vs. Jake, should Cobra be back on Twitter etc.)

Otherwise, just be aware that YouTube as we grow it will become a very powerful tool.

Where do I post Community Posts?
YouTube will notify you and a new tab will unlock. It's impossible to oversee it.

## Community Posts
Those of you with 500+ followers on YouTube will have access to the Community Posts.

If you have unlocked them, you will know.

Now, I recommend to make 3-5 community posts daily.

In your toolbox for posts are:
- Zion messages
- Zion messages + images
- Emails
- Promotional emails
- Promotional Zion messages
- Polls
- Memes

You always want to post Zion messages and an email.

My recommendation is:
1. Zion message + image
2. Zion messsage
3. Email
(4. Zion message/Poll/Meme/Promotion)
(5. Poll/Meme/Promotion)

With '+ image', I mean that you add an image from Tate or another person that fits you niche to the post. No edits, just attaching a picture to the post.

1-3 are what you should post daily.

4-5 are optional.

You can use polls to ask your followers about their opinion on a popular topic.

"Top G vs. Jake Paul" for example.

And use memes from the Meme folder inside the Tate library to spark things up.

A promotion can then either be:
- A promotion email
- A promotion Zion message

You will see, sometimes there are Zion messages where you can easily add a:

'Make it happen:
<youlink.com'

To the bottom because the Tweet is about money and adjust the 'make it happen' line accordingly to the Tweet.

Example:

"Brothers.

Your enemies are plotting your absolute destruction.

And they are not taking days off to "chill"

Do you understand?"

YYou can easily add here:

"Protect yourself:
