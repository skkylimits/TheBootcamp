# ⚠️ BEFORE YOU POST

Make sure you are familiar with the TikTok guidelines.

They are your master. If you break them, they'll delete your videos and ban them.

Here's a quick rundown of them:

## 1) Minor safety & Grooming behavior

Don’t upload videos where Tate talks about 18 years olds. Unnecessary risk to get attacked with this guideline, even if it’s legally completely fine, it's an unnecessary risk.

## 2) Dangerous acts and challenges

No videos showing ‘dangerous tools’, ‘dangerous driving’, promoting alcohol abuse, etc.

## 3) Suicide, self-harm, and disordered eating

Don’t upload videos about suicide unless it is unattackable from the angle of ‘downplaying suicide’. It has to be MOTIVATING purely. Probably best to stay away from it completely if you can't draw the line here.

## 4) Adult nudity and sexual activities

Avoid posting women in bikinis or very short dresses. I know there are models nearly naked on TikTok, but if they want to, they can get you banned. ‘Promoting sexual arousal’ is a banning offence and you want to avoid being able to be put into this category.

## 5) Bullying and harassment

Don’t upload videos where Tate makes fun of losers. Just don’t. They will be able to take it down.

## 6) Threats

Don’t upload videos where Tate threatens someone in any way. Even if it’s a joke. Don’t use them. “I’ll break your bones KSI” - that’s a threat.

## 7) Hateful behavior

Don’t upload videos where Tate insults someone. Especially if it’s directed to a group of people, it will be banned. If there’s an insult in your video, mute it completely, having it censored in the subtitle is not enough. Just cut it out completely and don’t mention it in the subtitles at all.

## 8) Violent extremism

I’m sure you know that anything that can be seen as ‘promoting violence’ is a no go. Tate saying men should start boxing is fine, but no machete clips or anything else.

## 9) Illegal activities and regulated goods

Content that displays firearms is specifically not allowed.

Anything that promotes smoking or alcohol is not allowed.

Showing money on the screen is not allowed.

Gambling is not allowed. Don’t show Tate’s casino.

## 10) Violent and graphic content

Should be an obvious one. No violence, fights etc. Professional fights of Tate in and of itself are fine, but NOTHING else.

But I urge you to PLEASE still read them in full.

Even though I know most of you will just skip it haha, but please, take the 5 minutes and actually read them. Getting banned is like dying and it takes 5 minutes to protect yourself:
