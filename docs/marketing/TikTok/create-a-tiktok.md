# Creating A TikTok Account

Important Note:
Creating a TikTok account seems like something you don't need a tutorial for, but there are common MISTAKES people make when they create their accounts which will negatively affect their entire journey – so, follow this guide.

Step 1 – Download TikTok

Just download the TikTok App from your AppStore or GooglePlay Store.

Step 2 – Disable any VPN you may have enabled

Also, if you're trying to do this tutorial from a Starbucks or public Wi-Fi, don't create the account there. Create it at home.

We want to minimise the risk of TikTok thinking you're a spammer.

Step 3 – The Setup

Enter your email, add your phone number as well (if possible) and create the account.

DO NOT change your username or anything else yet.

This is just about having the initial account, we'll change all the other things later and you'll get specific instructions and tutorials then.

For now, just having an account is ALL you need.
