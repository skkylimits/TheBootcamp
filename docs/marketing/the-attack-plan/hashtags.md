# Hastags

They are totally optional.

I grew big accounts while using them, and without using them.

Looking back at my experience, I recommend you to use them at the beginning of your account – first 4 days.

After that, it's totally optional. And I'll adjust my strategy in real-time in my diary based on real-time results.

You can then either follow me, or your Squad Leaders. So hashtags aren't a definite thing.

But when you use them – at the beginning for example –, I'd ONLY use 3 hashtags:
1) #cobra
2) Hashtag related to the topic
3) #cobra + topic

Example, Tate gives relationship advice.
1) #cobra
2) #relationship
3) #cobrarelationship

You will realise that there will only be very few #cobra + topic hashtags.

That's good, because we will CREATE this trend now.

The 'Cobra' trend has just started and you guys will be at the forefront of conquering the keyword and hashtag.

## New Strategy - Hastags

This strategy is specifically recommended for those of you who start with a new TikTok account due to the new format.

But you can also implement this new strategy into an already existing account and I recommend you to take advantage of it and compare the way your videos perform with this strategy compared to the 'Cobra' strategy over the course of multiple days.

Note: We do NOT use the word 'Tate'. And this is specifically for TikTok.

The 9 hashtags strategy:

We will use 9 hashtags with the goal to tell TikTok who our target audience is.

We will use 3 general hashtags, 3 topic hashes, and 3 specific hashtags.

General hashtags: #viral, #fyp, #fy

(You will get examples later. Those just very general hashtags.)

Topic hashtags: #millionaire, #money, #relationships

(One word that describes the topic of your video. You will get examples later)

Specific hashtags: #millionairetips, #mindsetmotivation, #relationshipsadvice

(Two word or more word combinations that narrow down the topic. If Tate is giving tips to get rich, then we will use #millionairetips, #millionaireadvice or #billionairetips)

Also, we won't use the #cobra hashtag with this method. We keep it non-Tate related.

## New Strategy - keywords

WWe are going to replace the use of Cobra with Tate's achievements.

In our hooks, but specifically in the description.

Tate talks about money? Billionaire talks about money.
Tate talks about dating? Dating experts talks about getting girls.
Tate talks about fitness? Kickboxing Worldchampion shares motivation secret.

In your hooks, you can still use cobra, because sometimes those achievements will be too long for a hook.

But in the description, we want to use achievements. Examples are on the next slide.

It is not 'MANDATORY', but I strongly recommend you to test it out.

## Keyword Examples
Money topic
- Millionaire
- Billionaire
- Centi-millionaire
- Rich guy

Mindset topic:
- Millionaire
- Billionaire
- Centi-millionaire
- Rich guy
- World Champion
- 4x Kickboxing World Champion

Relationship topic:
- Dating Guru
- Dating Expert
- Red-pill star figure
- Ex-Pimp
- Ex Elite Playboy

The shorter ones are best to be used for hooks. And the longer ones for descriptions.

## Crisis Hashtag strategy
#freetopg
#freethetruth

Are hashtags we will be using across ALL platforms in this example.

Avoid the 'Tate' keyword on TikTok, but leverage it on IG, YouTube and Twitter.

If a video would get removed, please inform your Squad Leader.

We monitored these hashtags and they're so far safe, and offer a GREAT opportunity to get our videos into the right eyes.

But in case they'd try to attack these hashtags, inform your Squad Leader and when we see a removal increase, we will inform you about the change.

But anyway, NOW is the time to perform.
