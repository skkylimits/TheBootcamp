# Mind Control Aikido

## THE POWER OF MIND CONTROL AIKIDO
Marketing is all about POW and PAZASS.

You need to make them think "Wtf??"

Admit you're a bit curious about the lesson I'm about to teach you.

Admit it.

THE LESSONS OF MIND CONTROL.

Wtf does that even mean?

And that's the point, you're curious, you want to know more.

You'll keep reading this lesson as long as I can KEEP that curiousity.

Why do you watch movies?

TO SEE THE ENDING.

It's curiousity, you get them on the hook.

The VERY FIRST THING people see, needs to intrigue them, it needs to make them want to see more.

They don't even have to like what they see, they just need to think WTF and want to learn more.

Do you know why a song gets stuck in your head?

It's because your brain is trying to figure out the ending. It's an unsolved problem. It's a mystery.

Once you have them on the hook, you got to keep them on the hook.

You need the video or writings to be entertaining the entire way through.

You need them to think there's some giant conclusion at the end.

Some huge secret mystery at the end, so they keep going.

THEN BAM, YOU GET MAGIC:

Did you clicked continue?
Why? Why did you do it? Do you understand the lesson?

## Applying this to our hooks
You always want to make people think:

"Wtf, I need to see this."

Clickbait hooks for example are extremely good at this.

"Tate Meets MAFIA BOSS"

Just makes you think: "WTF - as if he'll really meets one. I NEED to see this"

With clickbait hooks, you can turn:

"Tate on Mindset" into "Tate's $300M Mindset"

"Tate Gives Success Tips" into "TATE'S SUCCESS SECRET EXPOSED"

"How To Approach A GIrl" into "Make Her FALL IN LOVE On First Sight"

But it's not always good to go 'clickbait' and make these BIG PROMISES.

'Clickbait hooks' are defined by BIG PROMISES.

But you can't always promise big, because you can't always deliver.

There are situations where you could go on the edges, exaggerate a bit and make a 'clickbait hook' - But there are also situations where you shouldn't.

Situations where you can leverage the WTF effect fully, and where you can't.

You need to find the line.

And it's a fine line, because going clickbait when you shouldn't will make you lose trust.

And going 'simple' when you could go 'clickbait' (promise big) can make you miss out on views.

So,

The key is to make sure that when you go clickbait, there's SOME connection to the video.

You need to deliver on your big promises.

"Tate meets Mafia Bosses?" - make sure the people he meets AT LEAST look like Mafia Bosses.

They could even be super nerds, and then it's just funny.

But he can't meet just normal people, and you then tell your viewers they're mafia bosses.

You baited them to click in this case, and they won't like it.

When Tate talks about how to approach a girl, you can't say "make her fall in love on first sight" when he just says that you should smile, not be creepy and complement her.

But if Tate would mention that "if you do x, and she does y, it's game over.", then you can go with the clickbait one.

Because it's also only clickbait to a degree.

Tate himself made the big promise.

Obviously your viewers won't learn how to LITERALLY make her fall in love with them, but there's a connection to the video.

It's not actually clickbait, it's more like a exaggerated promise – and that's fine.

The problem is when there's no real connection.

"TATE'S SECRET SUCCESS MINDSET EXPOSED"

If Tate just shares some tips for a strong mind, 'secret exposed' doesn't REALLY make sense.

You could even argue that it's not really a 'secret' when he openly shares it.

I'd always keep it genuine.

You never want your audience to see one of your videos and think "Ah, just clickbait".

But there are situations in which you can leverage 'clickbait hooks' – which merely means promising big, and making them think WTF.

"The Matrix ATTACKED Tristan Tate"

This is a 'clickbait hook' - but as Tristan's account got suspended, it perfectly matches.

It makes me think WTF.

It's a BIG PROMISE.

But it also delivers on the promise.

It's "WTF -> DAMN -> LET ME SHARE THIS"

Not "WTF -> Ah, clickbait."

The first is what we want, the latter not.

So, keep this in mind when you do your hooks.

Leverage 'clickbait' and make BIG promises when the video delivers on the big promises, or there's a connection to the video.

If the video doesn't deliver or there's no connection, just keep it 'simple'.

And you can still make people extremely curious with a 'simple' hook.

"How Tate Deals With Heartbreaks"

It's SIMPLE, but I still want to see how he deals with it.

"Tate's Rags to Riches Story"
"How Billionaires Think About Money"

They are simple & genuine, and still interesting.

Leverage clickbait and make BIG promises when you can, and otherwise go simple and write your hook in a way where I also think:

"I need to see this."

"WTF. My girlfriend left me. THIS is the video I need to see."

"WTF. This profile has content that ANSWERS ALL my questions. Now I can learn how billionaires think about money. Damn. I need to watch this."

Do you understand?
