# Positivity

Morpheus hands you a pill and tells you.

"THIS WILL FOREVER ALTER YOUR MIND."

Do you take the pill?

I want you to think about the feeling and make a mental note.

Now imagine that instead of that,

Morpheus hands you a pill and says.

"THIS WILL FOREVER ALTER YOUR MIND FOR THE BETTER."

----------

Which scenario are you more comfortable of taking the pill?

Well I imagine most of you are gonna be more confident in taking the second scenario pill.

Why?

Because he GUARANTEED it would be positive.

When you ONLY say you will Alter someones mind? Maybe it's for the worse.

So always remember to make it clear the results will be what someone wants.

Positivity should always be implied.

## How POSITIVITY applies to your biography

Your Bio is a subtle sell on why people should follow you.

Many of you have Bios which just say things.

- Change Your Mindset
- Follow for more
- Daily Content

None of this is POSITIVE.

Why would someone follow for these things?

You should look to be making REASONS for them to follow.

- Daily life-changing advice from billionaires
- Centi Millionaire's Mindset clips
- World's Elite Best Kept Secrets
- Absorb the minds of the Greats

Your Bio is a SELL.

It's to convince them why your content is good for them, and to give them an idea of what content they will receive.

Always inject UPSIDE.

ALWAYS give them a REASON to follow.

Positivity.

Make them Lucky.

## How you can extrapolate this
You ALWAYS want to be a positive force in peoples life.

Positivity is addicting.

Every single video you post should have SOME kind of positive effect on your viewers life.

Also also when you're replying to comments, make sure your overarching goal is to be a POSITIVE force in peoples life.

Even when it comes to hate comments.

Spin them into something positive.

"He is such a mysogynist!!!"

- He isn't. He loves women. He takes on all the stress so they can live a happy life. Watch my last video, he explains his true view point there.

Bam.

You dressed the allegation and injected positivity into the comment section while selling people on your newest video.

The hater will likely still disagree with you, but it doesn't REALLY matter.

Anyone who is truly interested will read your comment, be curious to watch the new video you made and change his mind and leave with a positive view.

## How this applies to replying to comments
Whenever you reply to someone, make sure it is a POSITIVE interaction
