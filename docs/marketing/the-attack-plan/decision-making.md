## Raw Action
Raw Action is the absolute solution to everything.

Do you feel like your account isn't growing?

Do you feel like you're not making as many sales as before?

That's because you aren't DOING.

You need to constantly be innovating,

Your business will never reach a point where you just follow your schedule and make more money than before.

I have many of you STILL just putting the universal landing page in your TikTok Bio.

I have many of you STILL only having a TikTok account.

You're not DOING anything new.

I'm not saying to stop making the TikTok videos,

I'm saying you need to do MORE.

You need to stay up to date with the new strategies luc-ama-list

You need to stay growing and checking what other students are doing - Bugatti Examples.

You need to PANIC whenever you aren't making more sales than ever before - The Leaderboard.

You need to be ACTING.

Raw Action solves everything.

If you are not growing, you are dying.

If you are not learning a new thing, or working on a new aspect of your business.

You are dying.

There's always another layer to get into.

There's ALWAYS more action to be done.

I am here to make sure you're never lost on what to be working on.

But I can never do the work for you.

That's on you.

If you feel lost, listen to the last Luc lessons.

Read the last daily lessons.

Raw Action is the only way to get rich.
