# Descriptions

A good description works as a second hook and you can use it to build more curiosity around your video.

Good way to do this is by saying something about what’s going to happen inside of your video.

But WITHOUT mentioning what‘s actually happening.

Example:

The video is Cobra giving advice on how to deal with suicidal thoughts.

Now, you don’t mention anything specific about the advice itself.

Instead, you talk about the effect/results of this advice.

"This saved so many lives"
"Cobra is out here saving lives"

Same thing works for flexing videos where Cobra bought something expensive.

“I‘d do the same thing if I had millions of dollars“

Tell them that what happened was amazing.

Don‘t tell them what exactly happens, just tell them that it was amazing.

Like a little comment.

You can also hint at the end of the video here – to increase watchtime!

ANYTHING interesting happened at all at the end?

If so, use your description to build intrigue around that.

Life-changing advice?

“The quote Cobra mentioned at the end really hit hard.”

Funny?

“I didn’t expected the end 😂😳”

Flexing?

“Cobra makes the ridiculous $500M deal at the end”.

Those are the 2 main methods of using the description to your advantage.

⁃ Commenting on what happened (without saying what happened)
⁃ Hinting at the end of the video

It's actually quite simple.

Here's a quick exercise.

Look at your last videos, watch them until the end and then give yourself only 5 seconds to say something about it.

Or watch the video and say WHATEVER is on your mind while watching it.

This can give you an idea of what to make your comment about.
