# Creative brain power
Creative brain power is THE key.

You need to come up with new unique angles.

Especially when it comes to war times like the 'crisis-leveraging' videos, you need to find ways to combine clips that people either didn't thought of, or didn't implemented that well.

Look into the good-freetopg-examples, they are prime examples of what you need to do.

## People want to see your CREATIVE brain power
They are tired of seeing the same clips over and over again.

THAT is why superformat works so well.

It's something NEW.

When we make our 'crisis-leveraging' videos, the principles are the same.

Don't show them the same arrest footage over and over again in the first 5 seconds.

Make your hook INTERESTING.

Something that makes you yourself think: "I need to see this"

And remember, you're not limited to "Stage 1 is they cancel you, Stage 2 is they try and put you in jail..." clips.

Combine wholesome Tate content.

Look for his most pro-women clips.

You have UNLIMITED ammo.

The secret to being more creative?
Action.

It's a simple 2 step process.

Look at all the content you have, and THINK:

"How can I use this?"

Look at the good-examples or the videos that went viral, and THINK:

"How can I make this better?"

And then just try it out.

Step 1) is to give your brain ammunition for ideas.

Step 2) is Trial Error in the implementation.

And that's it.

But it ALWAYS starts with you starting to look for opportunities and ideas everywhere.

That's all it is.
