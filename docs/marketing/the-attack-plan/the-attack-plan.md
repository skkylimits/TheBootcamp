# The Attack Plan

why it's so important that you attack Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.

## Attack NEW social media platforms

If you want to win, you need to attack from AS MANY angles as possible.

The platforms we're going to attack are:
- YouTube
- Instagram
- Twitter

The way this attack is going to work is that we're going to create an account with our exact username on these platforms.

And then we're going to re-upload every TikTok video we made to these platforms.

Note: the video file that you uploaded to TikTok, this is the video that we will also upload to these platforms.

We are going to have an Instagram-, YouTube- and Twitter Day where we go in detail into all those platforms.

For now, the gameplay is to just repost all our videos there and plan the seeds for the BIG attacks.

You can reuse your profile picture, and the biography that we will create & write later on the platforms.

On the next 2 slides, you have a quick overview from me on the nature of these platforms.

P.S. If you can't get your exact username on these platforms, then you can use an underscore/dot between a word or at the end of the sentence. But avoid more than 1 underscore/dot!

I know on Twitter, some names are going to be too long, in those cases, shorten it up. And maybe you need to cut your username in half. That's just how it is.

## Instagram

When you post on Instagram, you can write a description and are also able to write hashtags.

For the description, write it the same way like you'd write your TikTok description â€“ and you'll learn tricks on writing one in Part 2.

For hashtags, I would not use hashtags. I tried it with hashtags and without and didn't saw any difference.

It's much like TikTok, if you want, you can use then. And if you want to, you can follow the formula we used on TikTok:
- #cobra
- topic related hashtags
- #cobra + topic related hashtag

As a general rule of caution I'd also stay away from #topg or #andrewtate here. They aren't a MUST AVOID like they are on TikTok, but I don't think it's worth to use them.

The gameplan for Instagram is also just to plant the seeds.

Don't worry too much about how many views you get, and don't worry about stories etc.

We will go into all of this later once we start the attack.

P.S. Views can actually be VERY delayed on Instagram. I've had cases where a video sat on 0 views for 2 weeks and then exploded to become my first 1M video. So especially stay unattached to the views on Instagram. Be happy if you go viral, and don't be sad if you don't here. ðŸ˜‰

## Twitter

Twitter is going to be the slowest growth platform of all.

Therefore this is really all about planting seeds for the future.

They are working hard on trying to get a Shorts function there, with an algorithm that competes with TikTok, so we're also trying to set us up well for the case that that's coming.

Now, it's important that we plant those seeds though, because WHEN it happens, we don't want to be the guy who 'just started' because of the trend.

No, we want to be the guy that posts value daily, for weeks & months.

Trust me, people don't want to follow the 'new guy', they want to follow the person who's been active for a long time.

Following you is an investment from their side into you, they don't want to waste their follows into someone who might stop posting in a week â€“ which is what 99% of people do.

So, when you repost your already made videos here, you can write the hook into the Tweet as well.

Until now you guys were only re-posting your videos on Twitter.

## Connecting Your Instagram and YouTube to TikTok

When you are in TikTok, click on the 'Edit profile' button.

The button is on the "Profile" page, it's below where your follower counts are.

When you scroll to the bottom, you can:
- add Instagram
- add YouTube

I'd connect both platforms. This way you may already gain some followers and a little boost on these platforms because people go from your TikTok profile to these.


::: details What's the gameplan for Twitter, Instagram & YouTubeThis question is required.

Post our videos made for TikTok there as well, and plant seeds for when we launch full attacks on these platforms.

## The New Tasklist Overview (Videos)
This overview is focused on the more specified Attack Plan regarding your videos.

3-6 videos remain the goal.
3 videos = normal assignment.
6 videos = hero assignment.

If you go for 3 videos:
- 1 Niche video
- 1 Stock video
- 1 Superformat video

If you go for 3-6 videos:
- 1 Niche video
- 1 Stock video
- 1 Superformat video
- 1 Creative/Super format video (Hero)
- 1 Creative/Super format video (Hero)
- 1 Creative/Super format video (Hero)

What is a niche video?

You pick a creator inside of your niche that is not Tate. For example, if you're in the mindset niche, you could use Arnold Schwarzenegger talking about discipline.

Then you make a normal Super format video with him.

What is a stock video?

Those are videos using the 'new-format' which means purely stock or lifestyle footages. You can show Tate in these videos, but I'd take advantage of stock/lifestyle footages that match what Tate is talking about.

You can use a niche creator for these videos too, but you'd still have to create a normal niche video. And I'd stick to using Tate in most cases.

What is a super format video?

This is our normal attack format. Lifestyle clip at the beginning with a hook, you know what I mean. The super format.

What is a creative video?

It's using a viral video idea, either Michael's, mine, or your Squad Leader's or maybe you came up with your own idea. The Senan format can work here as well.

But remember:

Make sure everything you do fits into your niche. If you think this would limit you in your clip-choice, listen to Luc's lecture on the next slide.

Bonus:

If you want to go super safe on TikTok, create a extra version of your videos where you don't show Tate in the superformat cover.

You will want to show him on the other platforms because it allows you to get a view boost.

But if you want to super safe, export an extra version where you don't show him.

## Opportunity in Crisis
Hey guys, so, this is phase 2.

This lesson will show you how you can take advantage of this 'crisis' where EVERYONE is talking about Tate and how you can turn it into something good.

Because Tate is â€“ once again â€“ THE most famous man on the planet.

If 2022 was a good year, 2023 will be great.

Search results are higher than ever. Peoples desire for gossip is higher than ever. But also peoples desire for TRUTH is higher than EVER.

And YOU are at the forefront of giving people the TRUTH.

The gossiping haters will try to argue on the truth and make a laughing stock of themselves and the people who are looking for the truth will find it.

That means a LOT of attention for your profiles.

If you continuously made your stories, made your posts, you will have made a nice rabbit hole that people can go down (new followers if they like it).

And in the NEXT 48 hours, we will use the new gained attention and followers to make SALES.

But before you will get a specific plan on how you can leverage this crisis, listen to Luc's lecture below, he talks about the Matrix attacks, what happened within the last 24 hours and how to take advantage of this 'crisis'.

### VIDEO

## What videos should I make to take advantage?
Inside the Tate Library, you'll can find all the ammo via #ftg #freetog inside the spreadsheet.

We'll also add a folder that contains all the ammo later on and inside the master-ammo-box is also ammo linked!

It's all the footage that will allow you to make viral videos in this situation.

Exemplary video ideas are:

1) Make your hook about "This is the guy they try to put in jail?"

And then show the most positive and empowering Tate videos.

Great examples are people who say that Tate saved their lives.

2) Take a tweet/video where the accusations are mentioned

And then take a clip where Tate/someone else says something that disproves the accusations.

3) Take a tweet/video regarding Tate's house being raided

And add Tate talking about them trying to put him in jail is Stage 2 because he exposes the Matrix and helps people.

GET CREATIVE!

EVERYTHING is possible.

And you can FRAME everything according to your niche.

Mindset niche? "Always be your enemies one step ahead. Tate saw this coming"

Also, a music tip:

"Crystal Castles Transgender" can give your video the perfect conspiracy vibe.

And remember that the fundamentals apply to these videos as well.

CATCH their attention. Then KEEP it until the end. And FARM for comments.

You can even do more than 3 of these videos a day over the next few days.

If a video does shit, just private it.

But THIS is a train I'd ride.

Mix these kind of videos then with super motivational and inspirational Tate videos that fit your niche so you can also gain followers from the attention you created.

And.. Listen to Luc's lecture on Video ideas below and the instructions he provided:

##  The Attack Continues
Today we will look into expanding the Momentum we have build.

Tate is still THE famous man, and his arrest is still an extremely hot topic.

It's not the time for sales yet â€“ if you have great momentum and 1k+ followers, you can do it, but I recommend to wait!

We now need to double down on the attack because a bunch of NEW ammo is coming our way.

This lesson will walk you through strategies to:
- Take advantage of this attack
- Convert attention into followers

## Taking Advantage via Twitter
There are certain things you can do on Twitter to get A LOT of views in this crisis.

One of these things is replying under Tate's tweets with one of your videos.

Enable notifications for Tate's Tweets, and post it as soon as you can as a reply.

(Once your account is older than 90 days, you can buy Twitter Blue to stay on top.)

Another tactic is using keywords in your Title.

"Andrew Tate", "Top G", "arrested", etc.

And the hashtag #freetopg is trending, so you can even use this one here.

Now, I'd not use the hashtag for every video because it can look spammy.

But every 3 videos is totally fine in this attack.

The keywords, I'd use them in every video and just switch them up.

- Tate
- Andrew Tate
- Top G
- Cobratate

Just make sure it's not too monotone.

Listen to Luc's lecture below where he talked about the first strategy of replying to Tate's tweets in more depth:

## Convert Attention into Followers
There are 3 very important things that you can need to pay attention to in order to leverage the attention you get to grow your accounts.

1) Your branding needs to be on point.

Perfect profile picture.

Great story highlights.

AND ESPECIALLY a biography that makes me understand what your profile is all about (niche specific).

Your bio should not talk about multiple things. ONE big idea needs to be dominant there and every line should SOMEHOW be connected to this idea.

If you want to help men to become powerful, then every line you write needs to be connected to that SOMEHOW.

Telling me I will get mindset lessons, isn't really connected to it.

However, telling my I'll learn the mindset of the most powerful men, is something different.

Make sure that every line you write makes me understand that it will get me closer to the what your brand will make me achieve.

In this example, every line makes me understand that you will help me in becoming a powerful man.

2) You need to have VALUE videos between the crisis videos.

That's why the daily assignment always contained 1 Tate video that's connected to your niche where Tate shares AMAZING advice.

They need to understand that you're not just fighting for justice, but also are fulfilling all your promises of providing immense value.

Because we've been attacking for over 3 days, today is a day, where I'd consider featuring a niche person, and where you can get an extra 'normal' videos out.

It's an AMAZING time to grow, but we can't forget about the value.

It's fine if you keep the normal amount, and if you continue like this â€“ but, you should have AT LEAST 1 video daily that's not a crisis video.

3) You need to have GREAT stories

Remember to keep the value in your stories.

Zion messages, lifestyle clips, shortened Zion message lifestyle clips.

USE your stories to show people the value you gained.

And if you noticed that you have much more story viewers after the crisis leveraging videos than before, then you can even make a story where you explain your profile.

Make a story in the format of a Zion message story and tell them:

"I appreciate all of you guys.

Normally, I post videos that <tell the the benefits of your brand>.

But right now, we're fighting for justice for Tate.

Let's spread the message for a few more days and show the world that Tate is INNOCENT! ðŸ’ª

#freetopg"

Something like this.

Where you make your new followers understand that this isn't the 'normal' â€“ and also encourage them to interact and share your videos in a subtle way.

## Can you give me a promotion plan, please?

Plan for everyone who has:
- Momentum (more views than usual) on one platform or 500 followers on one platform
- Frequently 500-1000 views on one platform

Day 1 - Valuable video & stories
Day 2 - Valuable video & stories
Day 3 - Valuable video & stories (AND testimonial video & promo story)
REPEAT

Note: You need 1k followers on TikTok. And only promote on the platform where you have the momentum. Stories will only work if you have momentum on IG.

Plan for everyone else:

Day 1 - Valuable video & stories
Day 2 - Valuable video & stories
Day 3 - Valuable video & stories
Day 4 - Valuable video & stories
Day 5 - Valuable video & stories
Day 6 - Valuable video & stories (AND testimonial video & promo story)
REPEAT

Note: You need 1k followers on TikTok. And stories are only for Instagram. 

# Crisis Push 3 Hook Ideas
"Tate's Money Program Returns"
"Launch Of Program That Got Tate Falsely Arrested"
"Program That Got Tate Banned UPGRADED"

## Comment/Description Idea Angle
"They falsely arrested him because of this program.

The Matrix wants you weak and poor, they don't want people to escape.

But Tate does, learn the truth about his program here:
<yourLink>"

## A Fundamental Overview
There has been a lot of new changes over the last few days.

Todays tutorial is dedicated to giving you an exact overview of the changes.

Topics covered:
- What's the best account to run?
- What link should I use? (Hostinger?)
- What videos should I post?

And at the end Luc makes a lesson on Sunken Cost Fallacy, addressing the recent changes.

## What's the best account to run?
There are basically 3 types of accounts you can:
- Tate branding; trying to look like Tate
- Tate Brand branding; trying to look like an official account of the Tate brand
- Normal branding; what we've been doing at the beginning

They all come with different advantages and disadvantages.

Tate branding:
- Difficult to establish
- High chance of getting banned
+ Utmost of credibility

Tate Brand branding:
- Easy to establish if you have good content
- Medium chance of getting banned
+ Lots of credibility

Normal branding:
- Longer time to build credibility
+ High longevity

Now, what do we recommend?
We recommend you to go for a Tate Brand account.

You want to look like an account that's officially part of the Tate brand.

Luc talked about this in the lecture below.

It doesn't mean that the other brands are bad, or not recommended. It's just that right now, we think this is the best move on the chessboard. If you want to switch to this kind of brand, I recommend to use your old account.

## What link should I use? (Hostinger?)
We recommend you to use beacons.ai as explained in the last tutorial.

You could also use a bit.ly, or a credible domain name, they are all fine.

You can also cancel your Hostinger plan.

It is not needed right now.

Once we attack Newsletter again, we might go back to Hostinger.

Luc also speaks about the links below:

## What videos should I post?
If you go for one of the Tate branding, go full Tate content.

Otherwise keep it 20/30% niche creators and 70/80% Tate.

In terms of stock videos and superformat, I recommend to change it up, but would also highly tie it to how your videos are performing on each platform.

If you have momentum on IG, and lifestyle videos perform best, I'd do more of them.

Be flexible.

And we still promote every 3 videos.
