# Watermarks

No watermarks.
The problem with most watermarks is that they can distract the viewer from the video.

A big logo? Distracts me.

A big text chunk that looks like your subtitles? Distracts me.

Distraction is bad.

When I focus on your watermark, I don't pay attention to the subtitles or what Tate is saying anymore.

Bad, VERY BAD.

It's harder to make someone watch your video until the end when he missed 2 seconds.

And he won't re-watch your video.

He'll just scroll further.

"Boring. Next one."

That's what he'll think.

## The purpose of watermarks

The purpose of watermarks is to brand your video.

When someone would steal it, they'd see your username.

Now, the art is to place the watermark in such a subtle way where it doesn't distract me.

Low opacity, tiny â€“ that's NEEDED.

You don't want people to actively read it.

Their brain would register that a watermark is there, but it's so subtle, their brain isn't intrigued to actively read it.

It's like when Tate wears sunglasses

They register that he wears sunglasses, but people don't focus hard on it and lose attention.

Same with a good watermark.

They register it, but don't want to actually read it.

Makes sense?

Now you'll learn how to create such a watermark.
