# Why

Why it's so important that you attack Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.


## It is crucial that we attack these platforms.

Not only would you in the case of a ban, be on multiple grids unkillable, but you'll also attract a much larger audience.

They ban you on TikTok?

- *laugh*
- You just go, make a quick story on Instagram, quick community post on YouTube, quick Tweet on Twitter and let your followers know where they can find your new account.

Obviously this is a scenario for the future when we REALLY attack those platforms and when you have 10' thousands and 100 thousands of followers.

But yeah, you guys will become unkillable and will also attract new people to your profiles because you attack multiple platforms.

## Why Stories & Tweets if no one sees them?

Seed planting.

The moment where you blow up and your videos go viral – which is FORCED to happen if your videos are good over a long enough time-frame – you NEED the hard work you've done before.

Nothing is worse than going on a profile and seeing a guy who's riding the hype.

Riding the hype = only active when a video goes viral.

When I have your video on my Instagram Feed, and I like it and then check out your profile,

Then I WANT to see active story posts.

On Twitter, I want to see amazing Tweets.

But not just recently, no.

I want to go DEEP into your highlights, and absorb the wisdom of the Zion Messages and get inspired by Tate's lifestyle.

You want to pull me into the rabbit hole of your account.

Not only to bombard me with massive value, but to also show me that you will not just stop posting once you get less viral videos.

It's always a relationship.

Even if you have 100 followers, you have a relationship with those guys.

How you do one thing is how you do everything.

You need to focus on giving those 100 people AS MUCH value as POSSIBLE.

And they will thank you for it by being active followers.

And ACTIVE FOLLOWERS who view your stories, like your posts will show the algorithm that YOU are one of those guys that KEEP people on their platform.

Which ultimately is what the want.

## Purpose of Community Posts, Stories and Tweets

The entire purpose is to give your audience a BUNCH of value.

If someone decides to go down the rabbit hole of your account, it needs to be an ENDLESS rabbit hole.

That's why it's so important that you even post Tweets and stories while you don't have followers.

The effort you put into them compounds.

Maybe you completely blow up tomorrow, who knows.

It will increase your credibility and the likelyhood of someone following you when he scrolls through your stories highlights and Tweets and realises that you've been posting life-changing value for WEEKS (maybe even MONTHS).

People will understand that you're not 'just in it for the money', but you genuinely put out life-changing information even before you blew up.

THAT is a MASSIVE credibility boost.

Everyone tries to be helpful when they blow up and people listen.

But only few put out life-changing information and tried to change peoples lives BEFORE that.

Keep this in mind.

Get those daily stories & tweets out, and post community posts if you've unlocked then.
