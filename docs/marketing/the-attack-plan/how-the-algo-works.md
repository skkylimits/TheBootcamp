# How The Algorithm Works

The algorithm cares about one thing, and one thing only.

And the is keeping people hooked on their platform.

It is designed to identify good content and push it to the right audiences.

So, if you're not getting views, there are 3 possible reasons for that:

1) Your content doesn't create the results that TikTok wants to see
2) TikTok is upset with you
3) You completely messed up

In most cases it will be either problem 1 or 2, problem 3 is very unlikely.

But I'll walk you through the fixes to all these possible scenarios now.

## 1) Your content doesn't create the results that TikTok wants to see
TikTok look at 2 metrics when it decides if it's worth to push your content out or not.

- Watch-time
- Comments

Saves and likes are also important, but the 2 above the are MOST important things.

Watch-time.

How to increase your watch-time? Make sure that you have a genuinely good video.

The editing needs to be on point, and the clip needs to be interesting so you keep my attention until the very end.

The first step you need to take when you have low views is, figure out if your videos are actually Bugatti.

Don't hesitate to ask your Squad Leaders for help here.

Comments.

How to get more comments? Comment fishing.

ALWAYS comment fish.

Even if you can't think of a good question, at least write a statement there.

The universe needs constant attack, so always do SOMETHING.

And make sure you reply to comments to spark discussions and squeeze more comments!

## 2) TikTok is upset with you
Yes, that's possible, but it's not game over.

It's just as if the football coach put you on the bench because he didn't liked your last performance.

Reasons for TikTok being upset with you is mostly because they didn't liked the performance of your video – so the fix lies in 1).

But suspicious activity from your network (VPN, public wifi can cause this) or a violations could also cause this.

The fix for it is simple.

High quality good content for 7-14 days.

That is when TikTok will give you another chance to prove yourself.

If it then likes your video, it will push out the old content as well.

If you fail, it's another 7 days.

EVERY account will go through such a phase at some point, and usually it's 3-7 days until TikTok gives you another chance, but it can take up to 14 days.

DO NOT create a new account if you're in this phase.

You will likely encounter the same problem on your new account at some point and you need to learn how to deal with it now.

Unless you have literally 0 views, you'll be in this phase.

And with high quality content I mean, I could publicly make a server announcement showing your video to everyone and you are able to proudly stay behind and say:

"Yes, I made this!" with a big smile on your face because you know it's a G video.

## 3) You completely messed up
How do you know if you messed up?

0 views for 7 days straight while uploading 2-3 times a day without any video breaking to 100+ views.

The only fix is a new account.

But only a few of you will be in this position.

You can get into it by showing suspicious network activity (VPN, public wifi, other people in your network doing weird stuff.)

I recommend you to consult your Squad Leader if you are in this situation.

## IG, YT & Twitter Growth
What made TikTok so attractive for creators from all over the world was that it was very easy to go viral.

Make a good video... boom. Viral.

Now, that changed lately and the TikTok attacks made it harder.

The way we're used to growing on TikTok doesn't apply to the other platforms.

They ALL require much more tenacity, and there are a few things you can do to speed things up when the algorithm didn't 'discovered' you yet.

## Consistent Attack is King
Let's say you're on Instagram experiencing low growth.

Here, I expect you to be making 5 stories per day, saving them all in your highlights and comment fishing under every single video while posting at least 3 of them per day.

Why should the algorithm promote your videos vs. the guy who does all these things?

If your videos are of the same quality, I will pick the other guy. He holds people longer on the platform with his stories and comments.

So, keep making consistent good quality videos and do EVERYTHING you can do.

Treat your 10 followers brand as if it was a 10M followers brand.

That is the secret.

## The Algorithm's Logic
The algorithm doesn't give every video a chance on these platforms.

If he gives you a chance and you don't deliver with a killer video, can take 7-14 more days.

That's just the game.

In his eyes, promoting your videos is a risk.

You're new on the platform, he doesn't trust you yet.

Why should he show each of your videos to 1000 people testing if it's good vs. just showing people the videos of already established guys?

IG & YT & Twitter care about the time people spend on their platform.

They don't want to 'risk' that people close their App because they saw a shit video.

Therefore, they'll push out videos quite slowly.

But that doesn't mean it's 'game-over'.

Every time a video does good, you'll gain followers.

And you're gaining more and more followers over time.

Those followers will then start to serve as 'examples batches' for the algorithm to evaluate how good your videos are.

It removes the 'risk' of showing it to random people to see how well people interact with it.

Once you have a follower base, your followers are doing that job.

And the algorithms will be able to judge if a video is worth promoting based in their interactions.

And yes, it can take some time to build a follower base.

Most people quit before it is built though – they don't understand the law of constant attack.

Now, you can artificially create the effect a follower base creates by leveraging the engagement rooms in your Squads.

Post a nice video, make a nice comment-fish attempt and get your Squad to help in boosting your content.

And make sure you do the same for them. Watching it all the way through is a must.

## Don't look like a Bot
If you NEVER had any views at all while doing all the right things, posting 3+ times a day, making your stories, using the right hashtags...

Then those platform might just think you're a bot.

The most obvious cause can be VPN usage, if you're using one, turn it off.

Another reason could just be that your uploading behaviour is bot like.

Do you just go on IG/YT/Twitter and post a video, and then leave the platform?

It's the most efficient workflow, but it can come with the risk of them thinking you're not a real human.

To fix it, spend ~ 5 minutes daily on these platforms.

But not mindless scrolling or just having it open in the background, no.

Go look for videos in your niche.

YouTube? Instagram?

Look for #mindset (or whatever niche you're in) and watch those videos.

If you like a video, give it a like and watch it till the end, if it's boring, skip it.

Be a normal human about it.

Now, I need to emphasise that we're not mindlessly scrolling.

We are scrolling with a mission.

We turn the fact that we should spend some time there into something good.

And we'll use our scrolling to find viral video ideas in our niche that we can steal.

For Twitter, just look at Tate's tweets, absorb the wisdom, steal some of them that you never saw before.

Also, are you uploading from a PC? For YouTube, it's not too bad.

But Instagram (and TikTok) will hate you for it. They're phone apps.

And every bot network uses PC browsers, so you're in that risk category by uploading from it.

If you have a phone, use it.

If you NEED to use the PC and there's no other option, then it's not game-over if you're a bit active there. But it's still not optimal – fix if you can!

## Understanding algorithms
Algorithms are designed to do a job.

For Youtube, TikTok, Instagram etc.

That job is to keep people on the platform, watching videos, scrolling the timeline and watching advertisements.

An Algorithm is designed to promote videos that do that job well.

They also suppress videos that don't help or are detrimental to the job.

The Algorithm is like a coach.

They decide who gets more playtime in the game.

A lot of you believe that the Algorithm does things extremely quickly, but it doesn't.

Lets suppose you post a video, and by all metrics it's a good video.

People who watch it, like and comment often, people often watch it all the way through, and people click on it or stay on it when it shows up on their feed.

The algorithm will think to itself.

"This new guy has potential"

Does that mean it's going to place your next video infront of the entire world?

Would the coach then make you the lead star player?

No.

If you hire a new employee, and he's amazing, do you automatically promote him?

No.

It takes time.

They need to prove themselves over a long enough timeline before you give them more responsibility and tasks.

If a new employee does a shit job the first day, do you automatically fire him?

No.

Maybe he's just not gifted, that's fine, we will see how he grows.

The Algorithm doesn't have bias.

It's testing you everyday.

"Shadowbanning" is just you being a shit player it doesn't want on the field.

But listen, it's not permanent.

If the coach only gives you 15 minutes on the field per week, but everytime he puts you on, you do amazingly, do you think he will keep you at 15minutes?

Yea, you were shit before, that's why he only gives you 15 minutes.

But if you're showing that EVERYTIME you get on the field, you're amazing.

They will give you more playtime.

It will take time.

Coach will bump you up to 20 minutes.

Still amazing?

40 minutes.

Still amazing?

1 hour.

Still amazing?

2 hours.

## The Algorithm will put your content infront of more and more people as you continue to prove that people like your content.
The Algorithm will put your content infront of more and more people as you continue to prove that people like your content.

Many of you think you are shadowbanned, but it's just the results of doing badly many times.

Imagine if you did an amazing first 50 videos.

So coach puts you as his star player.

But now, everytime he puts you in the field, you just do okay.

Well,

He's gonna restrict your time.

Yea, you used to get 8 hours playtime.

But now he's reduced you to 7 hours.

Still doing just okay those 7 hours?

He's gonna put you down to 6.

Coach doesn't care about you.

Coach wants the game to be won.

The Algorithm doesn't care about you.

The Algorithm wants to do it's job.

This is why sometimes it will take 10 good videos to start getting more views.

This is why sometimes it will take 10 bad videos to start losing a lot of views.

The Algorithm knows how well you are doing.

It looks at your statistics.

It's emotionless.

If 90% of people view your video all the way through?

If 95% of people click or watch your video?

You're good for the team.

But if someone has 100% Watch through rate?

If someone has 100% click rate?

GUESS WHAT.

Coach is gonna promote them MORE than they promote you.

If you are a star player, that doesn't mean you can get lazy either.

If you are a shit player, that doesn't mean you've lost all hope.

Maybe coach gives you 0 playtime.

How can you prove yourself?

Well,

Coach will put you in the game EVENTUALLY.

Maybe only for 5 minutes.

So you better make sure that when he does put you in, you do well.

Also, they put you in the game at random.

You cannot know which video they will promote for that 5 minute game time.

You might need to make 30 BUGATTI AMAZING videos, for them to promote only one for 5 minutes.

But if that video does amazing?

Maybe next time it takes 20 AMAZING videos for them to promote one for 5 minutes.

Then 10,

Then 5,

Then 1,

Then they extend you to 10 minutes,

Then 15.

etc.

## *It's ALL ABOUT YOUR VIDEO STATISTICS.  *
That’s why making a new account won’t help you. 

You’re still shit at the game.  

Coach will figure that out over time.  

You need to GET GOOD.

And if you PROVE you've been doing good stuff the last 40 videos.

But coach only tested two of them?

Guess what.

They'll test THE OTHER VIDEOS TOO.

You didn't waste your effort.

This is why some videos blow up 2 weeks later.

Coach thought it would be trash.

You proved coach you're good.

Coach tried your other videos and they did good.

Does this make absolute sense?
