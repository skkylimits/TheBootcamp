# Posting Rules

There are a few things to keep in mind when posting, those are:
1. Your Video
2. Space between posting
3. The 'Tate' keyword
4. Description and hashtags

1. Your Video
Your video is the most important thing.

It needs to be of Bugatti quality (that means it needs to be a perfect video).

The country you are in doesn't matter, and nothing else REALLY matters.

It's ALL about the video.

2. Space between posting

YYou want to space out your posts by 2 hours each.

That's optimal.

TikTok won't ban you or anything if you go below that and your posts are spaced with just 1 hour. BUT for the beginning (first 4 days), please stick to 2 hours religiously.

Do NOT go below that.

We don't want to make TikTok think we are a spammer.

After these 4 days, still keep the 2h spacing â€“ but if there's an emergency that forces you to upload videos fast, you can go below that for 30 minutes+.

This is just about looking as legit as possible.

3. The 'Tate' keyword

As mentioned before, avoid the word 'Tate' ANYWHERE inside of your videos.

Not in the subtitles, not in the hook, not in the description, NO WHERE.

It can drag the eyes of haters to your account which try to report you for stupid reasons, which is what we want to avoid.

'Tristan Cobra', 'The Cobra Brothers' â€“ just replace the word 'Tate' with 'Cobra'.

## Different Formats

How Often Can I Post These Formats?
Both Senan's 'Viral Tate Lifestyle' format and Michael's 'Viral Video Ideas' fall into the Entertainment category.

Therefore, if you post 6 videos a day, you don't want to have more than 2 of these kind of videos in total per day.

Either:
- 2x Viral Lifestyle
- 2x Viral Video Ideas
- 1x Viral Lifestyle & 1x Viral Video Idas

If there has been amazing lifestyle Tate content in the Telegram or Michael posted more banger ideas on some day than he already does, then you can go for 3 as an exception.

But that's a brutal exception.

You want to always post more VALUE than Entertainment.

Entertainment to get eyes on your page -> Value to convince them to stay.

If the ratio is even, or you have more entertainment than value on your profile, then people will follow you to see Entertainment.

They won't engage very well with value videos, and they also won't be as likely to buy from you.

People who subscribe for value have a stronger desire to actually buy from you at the end.

Therefore, keep the ratio 1:3.

If you post 3 videos per day, that means 2 interviews and 1 video of this kind of format.


##  YouTube FAQ

How do I post YouTube Shorts?
- On the phone you can select the 'Shorts' feature and on the PC you can just upload them normally and they will be converted into a short.

A short video has to be 1 minute long maximum, if your video is longer, that's not too bad. - You can just upload it normally.

Do we only post Shorts videos on YouTube, no longer videos?
- No, only Shorts. They're King.

## Instagram FAQ

Should I post my videos as Reels or normal videos on Instagram?
- Post them as Reels.

Do we only post Reels on Instagram, no pictures?
- Yes, only Reels.


## The FAQ

Can I post in other languages like for example Spanish?
- It can work, but I don't recommend it. You limit yourself to the Spanish audience and I'd only consider doing this as a side quest on a second account once you have 50k+ followers and made a few sales on your English account. And THEN simply have too much time available. English is where the money is.

I live in x country, no one speaks English here, does it matter?
- No. TikTok also has text recognition by the way, they aren't stupid. Just focus on good videos and they will be shown to the right audience.

Should I censor words?
- You don't need to. If you want to do it because you want to be super super safe, do not insert *beep* sounds or anything, just mute the sound when Tate swears and don't mention the swear word in your subtitles at all â€“ or just cut the part out.
- TikTok won't ban you for swear words unless it's a genuine insult, then just cut the insult out.
- You may turn 'fuck' into 'f*ck' â€“ that's okay as well. But it's not a BIG deal if you don't do it.

What's with profile pictures and my biography?
For now, it's not needed. We will go into this tomorrow!

How many posts should we aim for per day?
- You obviously do as many as you can, but your aim is 6.

Can I use Top G instead of Cobra?
- Would stick with Cobra for now. "Top G" could backfire, not confirmed, but a risk!

Should I mute it when the word Tate is said in the video?
-- No, not needed. Just make sure you don't have the words in your subtitles.

0 views? Is this normal?
-- Yes, totally normal for new accounts. Can actually take up to 4 days to see the first viewer.

What about showing cigars?
-- As long as the main point of the video is what Tate says and you can't interpret it as a cigar promo, it's fine. Just don't make a "Tate praises cigar" video.

Is the superformat mandatory?
- Yes

What about 'Tristan', do I need to call him 'Cobra' as well?
- No, the first names are fine. You can also say 'Andrew'. Just don't mention thew word 'Tate'.

Is it important when I post?
- No, not really. As we post 6 times a day we post at all times anyway.

Can I use previous videos?
- If think the clip you picked there was REALLY good, it's okay. But generally, make sure you make NEW videos. Don't get efficient or lazy ðŸ˜‰

How many life-changing videos should I upload compared to entertainment videos?
- I recommend not more than 2 entertainment videos day. You want to use entertainment to get attention, but have more life-changing stuff to KEEP people on your page. People interested in life-changing information are more likely to also spend money on that.
- If you don't have time to post 6 videos, keep a ratio of 3:1 â€“ value:entertainment

Can my username have underscores?
- Avoid it. Best to just combine 2 words that the hero name generator gave you. Maximum 3 words.

What about watermarks?
- Not needed. We will talk about that option as we progress in the Bootcamp and when it can make sense as your accounts grow bigger.

What about Follow 4 Follow?
- Do NOT do this. You will not look professional by following random people and it will not work. One good video can give you more followers than 1 month of 'follow4follow' would give you. DO NOT DO IT!!

Should I create a business account?
- No. It's not needed and might even make it that sounds get copyrighted. Just stay with the normal one.

Can I post in other languages like for example Spanish?
- It can work, but I don't recommend it. You limit yourself to the Spanish audience and I'd only consider doing this as a side quest on a second account once you have 50k+ followers and made a few sales on your English account. And THEN simply have too much time available. English is where the money is.

I live in x country, no one speaks English here, does it matter?
- No. Because we post English content, TikTok will be able to determine the best audience for it. And TikTok wants your videos to reach a good audience. If they are actually VERY good, then countries don't matter.

Should I censor words?
- You don't need to. If you want to do it because you want to be super super safe, it's okay. But do not insert *beep* sounds or anything, just mute the sound when Tate swears and don't mention the swear word in your subtitles at all â€“ or just cut the part out.
- TikTok won't ban you for swear words unless it's a genuine insult, then just cut the insult out.
- You may turn 'fuck' into 'f*ck' â€“ that's okay as well. But it's not a BIG deal if you don't do it.
