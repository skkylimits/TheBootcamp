# Engagement is King
Engagement is the King of all statistics.

I have not wrote a lesson on this but after months of looking at the best channels, speaking to the best channels and overall looking at the game.

It is clear ENGAGEMENT IS KING.

What is Engagement?

Likes.

Comments.

Shares.

Likes are easy, you just need good clips and good things people like. This is where if you are TOO controversial, you might struggle.

People Like what they agree with.

If someone HATES whats being said in the clip, they might comment to disagree, but they aren't gonna like it.

There's a low chance they'll share it either.

So you do want to think about your video and ask if most people will like or enjoy the video.

Comments?

Comments can be the most controlled and farmed.

You can ask questions to try and get replies, stuff like "Do you agree with Tate on this subject?"

You can do controversial comments using burner accounts,

There's many ways to FARM and OPTIMISE for comments.

Shares is another statistic that is MASSIVE for the alogrithms.

I know OF girls often deploy the tactic of telling their men to click "share" button on all their videos.

They don't need to actually share them, just the request to share a video is tracked by the Algorithm.

When it comes to the algorithm, it LOVES engagement.

Keep this in mind and understand its a critical part of the game.
