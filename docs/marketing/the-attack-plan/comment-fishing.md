# Comment Fishing

## Fishing

Having lots of comments helps to make your video go viral, so what we're going to do is we're going to use methods to engineer the amount of comments we get.

There are 3 major comment fishing methods:
1) Comment a question
2) Reply with a question
3) Ask a question in your description

Let's look at them now.

## 1) Comment a question

Comment on your own video and just ask a question connected to the video.

The goal of the question is to make people respond.

Example:

Ask people weather they agree with what Tate said or not. You can also add your own opinion here & don’t necessarily have to agree with Tate.

“I actually think x. You agree with Cobra or me?”

## 2) Reply with a question

Someone comments his opinion?

Ask him why he thinks that way.

Works best for people who disagree with Tate or have a different opinion because we want to inspire a discussion.

People arguing in the comments is the best thing than can happen to you in terms of engagement and we want to make it as easy as possible for people to start arguing.

Example:

“Can you explain why you think that?”

Now, don’t reply this to every comment. People will see it and realise that you’re just comment fishing.

Only make this reply if you think it really makes sense, and don’t try to force it.

If you think it feels forced, others will feel it too.

If you think it’s a good and justified question to the comment that was made, others will feel the same way about it.

As a rule of thumb, I‘d only reply to a comment once a video.

But if there are multiple ones where it really makes sense, sure, go ahead.

Would probably just formulate them slightly differently in those cases, so it doesn’t look too spammy.

## 3) Ask a question in your description

You can also use your description to make people comment.

The way it works is similar to the asking a questions in the omments.

Ask people to share their opinion and weather they agree or not.

## Comment Fishing Summary

The 3 methods are:
1) Commenting a question under your own video
2) Replying with a question to a comment
3) Asking a question in your description

Bonus method:
If you have multiple devices, you can also create another account on one of your other phones and comment on your own videos to start discussions.

But don't do it on the same device. TikTok won't show your comments then.

## Comment fishing method – Herd instinct

Get yourself a room full of people.

Take 15.

Show them 5 lines of a different length.

Make them pick the biggest one.

If the first 14 people ALL pick the wrong line, but with utmost confidence, laughing it off as an easy task.

Guess what the last person will do.

They'll probably just pick the wrong one too'.

80% people will act this way.

They don't want to be the one 'stepping out of line', they don't want to look like the stupid cunt.

For what? For some stupid line?

That's herd instinct.

Go with the herd.

The funny thing?

What I just explained to you happens subconciously.

"Ah, I must be wrong. Whatever. This is the right answer."

That's what they'll conciously think.

This same effect applies to your comment section.

If you've got a comment section full of negativity, people are more likely to take the negative opinion than the positive one.

"Ah, yeah, if I think about it... he really is an arrogant prick and this is dangerous."

Switch it up and make it that the entire comment section is full of positivity, and people will be more likely to adapt the positive opinion.

How we can leverage this for our comment section?

1) Dominate the comments
2) Build comment chains

1) Dominate the comments

Use alt accounts on a seperate device and comment on your own video.

By this you can control the direction in which people are going to comment.

And I'm not saying you necessarily need to make pure positive comments.

I recommend a mixture of positivity and disagreement.

Note: 'disagreement' ~ not hate.

"I think Tate's completely wrong here. I believe xyz. Proof me wrong."

That's how negative I'd go & I'd definitely use those comments.

It inspires a healthy discussion lead by arguments, not by hate.

But you don't want to comment this under every single video, because people will notice the pattern and they'll think you're doing this on purpose.

Switch up the accounts, change the way your formulate your disagreement and don't do it every day.

For positive comments, things like:

"Massive Tate W" always work.

But what's even better would be a personal story.

"This is so true. I experienced ..."
"This is so true. Back when I ..."
"This is so true. For example I .."

I wouldn't lie here and make the comment genuiene.

People feel if you just made it up for comments.

2) Build comment chains

This is a simple, but effective comment fishing method leveraging the 'Herd instinct' effect.

And this is more about the subconcious feeling of unity & having some fun with random only people together.

Here's what it is:

Every saw someone repeating the comment of someone else in a reply?

And then another person doing the same thing... and another one the same thing... and another one again.

"Tate W"
- "Tate W"
- "Tate W"
- "Tate W"
- "Tate W"

You can egineer these reply chains.

Either start them yourself:

"Can we get a Tate W chain in the replies?"

Or just randomly start one with 2-3 alt accounts.

"Tate W"
- "Tate W"
- "Tate W"

It's best when you can connect the word we use for the chain to the video.

For example, if there's a certain word that stands out in the video.

Then use this word.

Tate mentioning the word CASH 10 times?

Start a 'CASH' chain in the comments.
