# Writing hooks

Writing hooks is one of my favourite things, and we will go deeper and deeper into this topic over the course of the entire Bootcamp.

For now... know this:

The entire purpose of hook is to build more intrigue around the video and make people more interested in what's going to happen.

You need to make them curious about what will be explained/happen and make them feel that what they'll learn will change their life/what they'll see will be worth their time.

And when it comes to these hooks, there are 3 important things you need to keep in mind:
1) It needs to build curiosity
2) It needs to be easy to read
3) It needs to be in my area of focus

1) It needs to build curiosity

That's the by far most important thing.

The biggest mistake people make with their hooks is that they don't build curiosity.

How to build curiosoity the right way?

Think of the key topic of your video and make people understand that this is what the video will be about.

Example:

The key topic of your video is Tate talking about raising kids.

Just make your hook: "Cobra on Raising Kids"

"Cobra on subject x" is a simple, and extremely powerful way to build intrigue.

It just plays with the fact that people are interested in Tate's opinion on the certain subject.

"Cobra on x" became my favourite formula by the way.

"Cobra does x" plays with a similar idea. People are interested in how Tate does a thing they do/want to do.

"How Cobra Raises His Kids" for example.

"Why Cobra does x" also works, but I'd only use this formula for when Tate explains a controversial standpoint or a standpoint in general.

"Why Cobra Doesn't Respect Brokies"

With 'why' you always hint at an explanation.

And people will only be interested in explanations of things they don't understand or are cuious about hearing Tate's exact viewpoint; f.e. opinions on controversial topics.

So, I'd only use 'why' in specicially those cases.

Otherwise 'Cobra on subject x' & "How Cobra does x" are your best formulas.

For funny/flexing/Tate Confidential videos, it works similar.

Ask yourself, what's the main topic of the video?

Then use 'Cobra does x'

'Cobra Buys $500k Diamond Watch'
'Cobra Buys 2nd Bugatti'

Now, it's very important that the video itself is interesting and entertaining.

Otherwise the hook won't work.

You can also use a controversial statement

Hook Formulas Summary:
- Cobra on x
- How Cobra does x
- Why Cobra does x
- Cobra does x

Do NOT overthink your hook.

Just think how you would convince a friend to watch your video.

"Hey G, you need to watch this. Cobra talks about x"
"Hey G, you need to watch this. Cobra explains how he does x"
"Hey G, you need to watch this. Cobra explains why he does x"
"Hey G, check out the $500k Diamond Watch Cobra bought"

If you can insert your hook into a "Hey G, you need to watch this..." sentence, then in 90% of cases, you have a solid hook.

2) It needs to be easy to read

YYour hook should be bigger than your subtitles.

But it should not be 'too big' so that it takes up the ENTIRE screen.

Look at the example below.

That's the perfect size.

(Also, keep in mind that there's space on the left & the right. You ALWAYS want to have space there and NEVER have your hook take up the entire screen.

The like, comment, and save button are there, and if your hook is too wide, it will be hidden behind them.

You can download a template that allows you to see the interface buttons below so you never have your hook – and also your subtitles – take too much space on the screen:

You import it like you import the Placement Zone template)

3) It needs to be in my area of focus

As discussed in yesterdays placement zone lesson, it NEEDS to be in the red area.

Also, the hook needs to be on the same height as the subtitles.

But you orientate yourself on the subtitles, meaning:

You place the subtitles first, and then you put the hook on the same height. 

## Superformat & Hook FAQ

What's with Tate Confidential, do we also need a cover?
-- I'd use a cover when there's too much happening in the background that could distract someone from reading your hook. Otherwise, you don't NEED it here

Does this also apply when a new interview comes out?
- For 12-16h after a new interview comes out, it's fine to leave the cover away and just have the hook there with the interview itself in the background.

What if there is no good lifestyle clip and a picture fits better?
- Then you can also use a picture, that's okay. But I'd make the picture zoom-in, so it's not too boring.


Can I also use other footages?
-- Yes, sometimes that makes sense. I'd ALWAYS try to stick to Tate footages though as they in 99% of cases better, but you can use websites like https://pexels.com to get general stock footages as well.

I still struggle with picking a hook, any help?
-- Just use 'Cobra on topic x'. You can't fail with this one. Also, feel free to tag me in ask-ole and try to convince me to watch a video in a "Hey G, you need to watch this..." way – I'll give you some pointers then.

## Hooks Mentality
The key to writing good hooks:

You need to put yourself into the viewers shoes.

You need to read your own hook and be able to understand what he might think.

When you write your own hooks, you need to know what effect you want to create in their brain.

What questions you want to create, what interestes you want to speak to.

YOU NEED A PLAN.

You need to know your goal.

And that's the greatest issue people make with their hooks, they don't have a clear goal in mind.

They didn't planned out what they want people to think.

And to even have a goal, you need to know the benefits your video provides to people.

Let's say the benefit of the video is that Tate talks about how if you work hard, you'll get everything you want, and the universe will reward you for it.

You need to take this topic and you need to make sure it speaks to people's desires, and to as many people's desires as possible.

What you'll learn now is all about optimisiation.

"Billionaire on hard work" is completely fine in this context.

But you only spoke to one of many desires that your videos satisfies.

The guy who wants to learn more about how the universe works, he won't be interested.

You could say "Billionaire Explains How Universe Works", but you wouln't speak to the people who need motivation and are interested in hard work.

So, to speak to the maximum amount of people, you need to make sure your hook speaks to all their desires.

Sometimes it's hard to combine the desires.

You need to get to the core of it.

Someone who wants to learn about the importance of hard work, why does he REALLY want to watch your video?

He wants to be successufl.

That's it.

Only people who want to become successful care about hard work.

So, we got 2 desires pinned down now.

- Desire to become succesful
- Desire to learn how the unvierse works

Now, it's just about combining them.

"Billionaire On Universes Law Of Success"

Boom.

Would be cooler if we could make it that Billionaire explains or reveals the universes law of success, but it'd just get too long.

But we managed to speak to 2 desires of people.

Our target audiece is broader now.

There are more people to reach.

What are the desires that my video satisfies?

Ask yourself.

What problem does it solve?

How can I convince someone that hearing this is what they NEED to hear.

REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.

People are selfish.

You need to speak to their desires.

You need to make them think that the benefit your video provides is something they NEED in their lives.

Imagine I have a phsycical store.

And I'm selling steaks.

That's my entire business.

I have a sign outside my store that says:

"Hungry? I've got the best steaks in the country."

I communicated the benefit of my store perfectly.

But what about some vegan?

Would be even better if I can at the same time convince them that they NEED my steaks.

Same thing applies to your hooks.

Billionaire talks about getting girls.

Billionaire talks about how to approach girls.

How do I reach people who aren't interested in 'getting girls'.

Who just focus on money, fitness and don't care about girls?

"Girls Provide Spiritual Peace"

Boom.

Now they have a reason to learn 'how to get girls'.

## Hook Training
Today we'll do more hook training.

The first few seconds are the MOST important ones.

Therefore it's very important that we nail those first few seconds.

We could have an amazing video, but if we don't catch someones attention in the beginning, then they'll never get to watch our amazing video.

So, today I've got 3 clips for you.

You need to select a timeframe of the clip that you'd use for a video, and then come up with a WTF hook for each of them.

Example format:

Clip #1
Timeframe: 0:20 - 1:10
Hook: Naps Make You Weak

But before that, here's a quick recap:

## WTF Hook Recap
The goal is to make people interested in watching your video.

You do this by making them think "WTF".

But not in a way where they have no idea what your video could be about.

"Rabbit Closes Chocolate Door" - This is a WTF hook, but it doesn't imply any benefit.

You want to use words that make me understand that there could be some benefit in the video.

"Make Fate Your Ally"
"A Test For Friends"
"Naps Make You Weak"

They all make you think "WTF" as you're like :

"What does he mean??!"

But in a positive way because they all suggest that there's a benefit in the hook.

"Make Fate Your Ally" - I want to have fate on my side.
"A Test For Friends" - I want to know if my friends would pass this test, or if I'd.
"Naps Make You Weak" - Hmm, this is something many people do/I do sometimes, I wonder what's the reason for that.

Your hook should be something that only makes sense after you watched the video.

And it should contain words or should be written in a way where I know that there's a benefit in me watching the video and clearing the confusion.

But now, let's get into practise.

Make the timestamps, and come up with your hooks.

Example format:

Clip #1
Timeframe: 0:20 - 1:10
Hook: Naps Make You Weak

Take note of everything in a google document, we will then randomly pick examples and review them in the next hook lesson.

## The 3 Things
1) What's the key lesson?
2) What's it that made me watch this video until the end (and kept me hooked)?
3) Don't give a summary!

## Keep this also in mind
Always ask yourself who does your video help, and then if your hook speaks to those people.
