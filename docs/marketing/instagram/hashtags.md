Important: You need to RESEARCH the hashtag you use before you use it.

It is important that the video you posts is exactly what people who are looking at this hashtag are interested in.

#billionaire, #money, #luxuary

If you look at these hashtags, you will realise they aren't very suited for interview videos. They are mostly just lifestyle videos of people flexing.

Therefore they are NOT good hashtags and they will confuse the algorithm because those people aren't interested in your content.

So, make sure you RESEARCH the hashtags you use first.
