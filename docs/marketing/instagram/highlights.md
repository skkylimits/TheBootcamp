# Instagram | Story Highlights
After you now know how to make amazing stories, it's time to introduce Story Highlights.

They make everything look more clean, professional and BUGATTI.

It allows you to save all your stories and make them accessible when someone clicks on your profile.

Even if no one looks at your stories now, you can save them into your Highlights and make them accessible for the future.

Let's say it takes you some time to blow up â€“ 1 month. If you then blow up and people look at your story highlights and see you've been posting these daily for WEEKS, they'll be more likely to follow you because they can see you are active.

To create a highlight, just look at one of your last stories, and then click the heart symbol in the bottom right.

You can then create a highlight.

I recommend to create 3 highlights:

- Motivation
- Wisdom
- Lifestyle

Motivation can be every story you make that you think can make people motivated for action. It can be a Zion message, a lifestyle clip with music with/or without a shortened Zion message.

Lifestyle will be all the Telegram footages with the music (and the shortened quotes).

The wisdom highlight will consist out of all Zion messages.

Now, to make them look BUGATTI inside of your profile, you'll need to create a BUGATTI COVER for them.

Alex shows you how to create one below.
