# Instagram | Stories

There are 3 types of stories we will leverage:
- Lifestyle footages with music & shortened Zion messages
- Lifestyle footages with music
- Zion messages

I'll show you below how these stories will look like and how to create them.

How many of them do we post?

3-5 stories per day. You can switch it up daily to have some variety.

It should be more lifestyle stories than Zion Message stories.

If you post 5 stories, it's 2 Zion Messages.

If you post 3 stories, it's 1 Zion Message.

Can I repost my Reels in my story?

Yes, but I'd only do this once per day.

Post your best video of that day in the story.

But don't post the actual video â€“ go to the Reel you posted, click the share icon (paper fly) and then select 'Add reel to your story'.
