# Biography

### VIDEO

The entire goal of a biography is to tell someone why they should follow you.

Obviously, "Hey, follow me!" â€“ isn't very convincing.
Neither is "Follow me or you will die!".

There are levels to creating bios and we will start with level one which is:

## Generic Bios

A simple communication:

Tell people how often you post, what you post, and what effect your videos will have on your life.

Let's take my profile as an example.

How often do I post? 6x a day.
What do I post? Life-changing and entertaining Cobra clips.
What effect do my videos have on my viewers life? They will learn more about the world and themselves.

Now, writing all these out will make it that I simply have too many words for my bio, so we need to shorten things up.

'6x a day' â€“ this is already short, but an outside guy won't know what I mean, so we will make it:

- 6x Videos A Day

'Life-changing and entertaining Cobra clips.' â€“ it's very long, so I will shorten it up and concentrate myself on the 'life-changing' side of my answer:

- Clips That Improve Your Life

You can play with the wording and think of different ways to say things by the way.

Something you can do is, take your answer and then FORCE yourself to communicate the same thing with different words 5x.

Example:

'Life-changing and entertaining Cobra clips.'
1) Life-changing Clips
2) Life-changing Cobra Clips
3) Value & Entertainment
4) Videos That Improve Your Life
5) The Best Cobra Clips

Makes sense? Also, make sure there's always a positive spin on what you say here. It needs to be a POSITIVE thing.

"Yes, I want the BEST clips! Yes, I want clips that improve life!" â€“ make them think that.

'They will learn more about the world and themselves.' â€“ this is very long, I'll shorten it up and I will think of an example how 'learning about the world & themselves' can show itself in their daily life.

Examples I have in mind are:
1) Become More Powerful
2) Feel More Powerful
3) Gain Full Control Of Your Life
4) Achieve Anything You Want
5) Absorb Cobra's Wisdom

Personally, I like the idea of:
- Absorb Cobra's Wisdom

and will go with that.

"6x Videos A Day
Clips That Improve Your Life
Absorb Cobra's Wisdom"

This is my biography now.

You are free to copy the structure and encouraged to find your own little way to say things.

We're going to go much deeper into biographies, but for now, if you implement this â€“ you'll have a MORE than SOLID bio. (Better than 90% of accounts.)

On the next slide, we will fine-tune the way our bio looks.

## How To Write Unique Bios

No more generic bios. That's over.

Get specific and show people why need to follow YOU.

I want you to understand that the first biography you guys learned to write are fine, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with itÂ â€“ but they are NOT unique.

And you NEED to be unique.

Everyone can post 6x videos a day, everyone can post videos about mindset, motivation, women, wealth.

But why should they then follow you if everyone else is already doing it?

We now enter the New Era and that means you need to get specific.

I need to know SPECIFICALLY what benefit you bring to my life and what makes your profile so unique and better than others.

And to do it, you need to leverage s specific idea.

Your Specific Idea

hThink of the niche you picked, and the videos you plan on posting.

Now I want you to imagine who those videos can help and how their life can change if they absorb all the knowledge.

Example: 'Soliders Mindset' posts videos about mindset and features military guys like David Goggins.

Forge Your Soldiers Mindset
-- Learn from Ex-Military Guys --
AND DEVELOP IRON DISCIPLINE

This is super specific.

I can imagine how this will transfer to my life.

I can imagine how having a Solider mindset will allow me to crush all my goals with ease.

But the most important thing is that this bio consists of ONE IDEA.

You need to have ONE IDEA inside of your bio.

Saying 'AND DEVELOP IRON DISCIPLINE' at the end only makes sense and works well because it connects to the what's been said before.

My brain will connect iron discipline to the soldiers mindset.

But if my bio was:

Revealing Secrets Of The 1%
-- STEAL Their Methods --
AND DEVELOP IRON DISCIPLINE

'AND DEVELOP IRON DISCIPLINE' doesn't make any sense here.

The ONE IDEA is about having access to the secrets of the 1%.

Developing Iron Discipline doesn't connect here.

Revealing Secrets Of The 1%
-- STEAL Their Methods --
AND ADOPT THEIR WORK ETHIC

'AND ADOPT THEIR WORK ETHIC' this would now make sense.

It connects to the secrets of the 1% â€“Â I can become more like them here, and their work ethic is one of the secrets you will reveal.

Do you understand?

It ALL needs to connect and be one big idea.

And you should notice how I am very specific.

"Steal Their Methods"
"Adopt Their Work Ethic"

I can imagine in my head how knowing their secret methods and their work ethic can benefit my life.

Same thing with

"Forge Your Soldiers Mindset"
"Learn From Ex-Military Guys"
"And develop iron discipline"

I can imagine in my head how having the mindset of a solider, and their iron discipline can benefit my life.

And this applies to every single niche.

Relationship niche?

-- The 1%'s Relationship Secrets --
Never 'Not Know What To Do' Again
AND BECOME A 'WOMANISER'

Specificity is King.

I can imagine how it would look like to always know what to do, and how easy everything would be if I was a 'Womaniser'.

Do you understand?

1) Think of your niche
2) Think of the effect consuming your content daily can have on your viewers life
3) And think of an example of it can transfer to every day life

1) Mindset / Relationship
2) They will become more disciplined / They will always know what to do
3) They will have a solider (known for discipline) mindset / They will become a 'womaniser'

## Biography Finetuning

As you know, everything needs to look aesthetically pleasing.

And when you write your bio, you don't want to go past 3 lines AND you also want to have the length of your biography in one of 3 formats.

Either in the square, the pyramid or the mixture format.

```
Square:
------
------
------

Pyramid:
---
------
---------

Mixture:
----
-------
-------

What you want to avoid is:
---
------
--

or

----------
----
-------------------
```

Or some weird stuff like that.

Now, with my bio example (and with many of yours) we naturally won't always be able to get close to the optimal format. So, what we can do is, we can add dashes or emojis on ONE line to adjust it.

6x Videos A Day
Clips That Improve Your Life
ðŸ§  Absorb Cobra's Wisdom ðŸ§ 

6x Videos A Day
Clips That Improve Your Life
- Absorb Cobra's Wisdom -

Don't overload yourself with emojis and only have them optimally in one line. Now, after these adjustments, my buy is now in the mixture format.

Most of you will likely end up in this format.

If for some reason your 2nd line is just too long, then you can also add 2 dashes.

6x Videos A Day
Clips That Will Improve Your Life
-- Absorb Cobra's Wisdom --

Or if necessary, add an emoji to that.

6x Videos A Day
Clips That Will Improve Your Life
- ðŸ§  Absorb Cobra's Wisdom ðŸ§  -

Makes sense?

- Aim for 3 lines of bio.
- Aim for Square, Pyramid or Mixture format
- Use dashes and emojis if needed

P.S. Use 2 similar emojis on both sides, and have dashes on both sides.

## Biography additions

Take your username.

What words are in there?

How can you SOMEHOW connect it to your bio?

'Fishing' = You fished the best clips on x.
'Fishing' = You fished out of 1000 hours of content to give people the best 30 sec clips.

And THINK what results you want your viewers to get form your videos.

Mindset?

A good mindset can result in a lot of different things in life.

- Hard like a solider
- Disciplined like a solider
- Disciplined like a world champion
- Productive like a high achiever
- Having the same mental models as the top 1%

You can use one of MANY of such ideas in your bio as well.

"The mindset that forges you into a high achiever"



## TikTok

On the phone, TikTok bios are centered, and it will look weird if there's only a dash or emoji on one side.

I'd also always go for writing every first letter of a word big, I think it's the most pleasant to read for those short TikTok bios.

## Instagram

It's fine if you just copy your biography the way it is on TikTok to Instagram.

But, if you want to, you can adjust it a bit as the Instagram bio format is a bit bit different.

On Instagram, the bio is aligned to the left and you can switch up your emojis a bit and the format isn't THAT important.

6x Videos A Day
Clips That Improve Your Life
ðŸ§  Absorb Cobra's Wisdom ðŸ§ 

You can turn this into:

6x Videos A Day
Clips That Improve Your Life
ðŸ§  Absorb Cobra's Wisdom

Or, and this is something that's very popular on Instagram, add an emoji before every line.

ðŸŽ¥ - 6x Videos A Day
ðŸ“ˆ - Clips That Improve Your Life
ðŸ§  - Absorb Cobra's Wisdom

And, on Instagram you have more words available. So you can add a Call To Action to follow you here as well at the bottom. I'd do this one without any emoji.

ðŸŽ¥ - 6x Videos A Day
ðŸ“ˆ - Clips That Improve Your Life
ðŸ§  - Absorb Cobra's Wisdom
Follow To Stay Updated!

None of this is NEEDED, you can just copy it directly, but if you want, you can make these little adjustments! We will also cover more ways on our Instagram day.

You can either keep every first letter of a word big, or you can make it in normal letters. Both is fine here.

## Twitter

On Twitter, everything will be converted into one line.

So, what I'd do is, I'd add a dash between every line as a divider.

Unordered version:

6x Videos A Day
Clips That Improve Your Life
ðŸ§  Absorb Cobra's Wisdom ðŸ§ 

Twitter version:

6x Videos A Day â€“ Clips That Improve Your Life â€“ Absorb Cobra's Wisdom.

You can also make it it tiny letters, as it may read easier and you can add/or leave the emoji away if you had to add one.

6x videos a day â€“ Clips that improve your life â€“ ðŸ§  Absorb Cobra's wisdom.
