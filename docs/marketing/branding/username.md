# Picking a username

A username can be anything.

You don't need to have 'mindset', 'motivation' or anything like that in your username.

'PricklyToothphase' can be a good username.

'AdidasPepe' can be a good username.

Just needs to be some unique or cool words combined.

'Honorable Leopard'
'EarthMerlin'
'AncientSaviour'
'CalmVulture'
'ThunderingMastermind'
'OrangeSage'
'ThunderingWhisper'

Those can all be cool usernames.

To save yourself time so you don't need to search the dictionary for words, you can use SuperHero name generators like these ones:
