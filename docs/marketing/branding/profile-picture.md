# How To Create A Profile Picture

Alex' has an amazing tutorial for you on this.

Before you watch it, you will need:
- A username
- A background picture

The username? You created that one yesterday.

For our example, our username is "Galactic Whiz"

The background picture? Here's how you find a good one:

You want to make sure the picture is somehow connected to your name. So what you'll do is, you'll search for one of the words of your username on Google for images.

Example search:

"Galactic"
"Whiz"

Sometimes, none of these results will make sense or look good.

So often times you can find nicer pictures by adding 'cartoon' to your search enquiry.

"Galactic Cartoon"
"Whiz Cartoon"

If EVEN after this search, nothing cool pops up (or just weird products, whatever), think of another word that connects to your brand.

Galactic? Planets, Galaxy, Universe
Whiz? Supersonic, clouds of smoke.

Now, after you found a picture that's colourful and you think would make a good background, watch this tutorial from Alex.

Note: It requires the free App CapCut & Alight Motion for your phone. It can work similar on Premiere, but CapCut is optimal here.

P.S. If you can't get the Alight Motion App, it's fine.
P.S.S. Don't use Tate as a profile picture
