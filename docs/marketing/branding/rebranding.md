# Law of Rebranding (Improvement)

Whenever you have a better brand idea, you should never hesitate to implement it.

There are only a few scenarios where you should be hesitant and that is when you rebranded multiple times in the same week.

That's too much – but thus should not happen to anyone of you.

Now, you can ALWAYS rebrand and SHOULD rebrand if you have a better brand idea.

You may wonder:

"What will my followers think, won't they be confused?"

And the answer is that it really doesn't matter that much.

Yes, if you change EVERYTHING – pfp, username, video style.

Then yes, they'll be a bit confused, but there's a smooth way to deal with that.

But there's basically only 2 kinds of rebranding which is:
- Hard rebranding (where you change EVERYTHING)
- Normal rebranding

We'll look at both kind of rebrandings now.

## Hard Rebranding

When you're going to change EVERYTHING, then you don't want to change it all at once.

Give your followers 4-7 days to get used to the change.

1) Start with changing your video style.
2) Then change your username
3) Then change your profile picture

Changing your banner, biography – this is stuff that you can do at any of these 3 steps.

Now, you want to get them used to the new video style within 3 days.

And then you can make the username change, and the profile picture change, either on the same day after.

Or you give them 3 more days to get used to the username change, and then you change your profile picture.

Up to you, maybe it feels to quick for you to do it all in 4 days, but I think it's enough.

The reason we give them a few days is, is because we want to make sure that your active followers understand the change.

Those who didn't realised it after 4 days, they didn't really cared anyway, and if they like your new videos, they won't care about any branding changes.

## Normal rebranding

If you change your pfp, username, or video style.

Then you don't need to worry about anything.

Just do it now.

If people likes your videos once, then they'll also like them when you post them under a different username or with a different profile picture.

If you change your video style, then I assume it looks much better than before and your followers should like it as well.

The correct steps are very simple here.

Just change it.

Boom. Bam. Done.

## Importance of delivery

Think of your favourite Tate rant/speech.

The one that REALLY lit up a fire inside of you or changed your mentality.

If Gary Vee would gave the exact same speech, the message and ‘value’ in and of itself would be the same.

But I guarantee you it wouldn't perform as good as if Tate gave the speech.

Because delivery is part of the value distribution.

If you were to put some ‘quack' noises all over the most inspiring and powerful Tate speech, it wouldn’t perform as good as if there was a song on top of it that perfectly matches the vibe.

If your valuable video is boring, and/or you delivered it in a bad way, it obviously will perform bad.

The first 1-5 seconds need to be intriguing.

The editing needs to be engaging and keep my attention.

The video can't look awful and the aesthetics need to look pleasing.

In the say way Tate's body language and tonality is optimised to get his points across.

You need to optimise your video to get the value across.

Always remember this.
