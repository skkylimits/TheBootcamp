# Your Story Highlights

Your stories & story highlights should fit your brand.

The stories you post need to match your brand.

Lifestyle stories you post should represent the 'lifestyle' someone would live if they followed your teachings perfectly.

Money niche? Rich lifestyle.
Mindset niche? Rich lifestyle.
Motivation niche? Rich lifestyle.

They are very much the same.

Relationship niche? Being with women lifestyle, maybe even partying.

Those are the RAW lifestyle stories. They should represent the perfect life your viewers should have by following you.

You CAN show Tate himself in the stories if it makes sense here.

Otherwise you can also go to the Stock Footage Library and search for videos there. Or go onto https://pinterest.com and look for videos of your niche there.

For the 'shortened Zion Messages' you can show Tate here and you can pick a lot of different clips as here the focus is more on the words than on the lifestyle.

Showing Tate in his Bugatti and then having a shortened message about being THE MAN to attract women will make perfect sense.

The Zion Messages that you pick itself should be tied to your niche.

Relationship Zion messages for the relationship niche.
Mindset Zion messages for the mindset niche.
