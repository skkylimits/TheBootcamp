# Why Is Live Chat Important?
Having Live Chat on your Landing Page will allow you to speak to potential customers

You will be able to answer any questions or doubts they may have

And you will be able to guide them towards purchasing The Real World (Sell them the product)

Adding Live Chat will result in more conversions (more sales for you)

It’s an important and profitable skill to have

Live Chat will give you the opportunity to work and improve that skill

And make you more money in the process

# # How To Connect Live Chat
To add your own Live Chat to the Universal Landing Page or ULP, you will need a chat service.

Our recommendation is https://www.tidio.com/

Step 1:

Create an account on Tidio (Free plan will be enough for now)

Go to “Settings”

Go to “Installation”

Look for “Installation Link”

That’s the code we will be using in the next step

Step 2:

To Install Tidio on the ULP you will need to find your Tidio Chat ID.

For example here is the full link:

<script src="//code.tidio.co/xjxz8xde2lcgij8tyrbh0el4x9ppcdqy.js" async></script>

Your Tidio Chat ID will be the code between` "//code.tidio.co/"` and `".js async></script>"`

In this example it will be "xjxz8xde2lcgij8tyrbh0el4x9ppcdqy"

Note: Your Tidio Chat ID code will be different from mine. DO NOT COPY PASTE MY CODE.

Step 3:

Now you will add your Tidio Chat ID to your affiliate link.

For example my affiliate link is:

https://www.therealworld.ai/?a=pgdbghzm

For this to work properly you MUST add "&live=" in between.

When combined your Tidio Chat enabled affiliate link will look like this:

https://www.therealworld.ai/?a=pgdbghzm&live=xjxz8xde2lcgij8tyrbh0el4x9ppcdqy


If you followed the steps correctly you should see your own Tidio Live Chat appear on the ULP.

Now you can chat directly with customers yourself and start selling them The Real World.

Updating Your Domain Redirect (Or TinyURL Shorten Link)

Keep in mind that now we have changed our affiliate link

Because we added our Tidio Chat ID

Which means you will have to REPEAT the process from Day 14 lesson

If you used TinyURL follow these steps:

Open https://tinyurl.com/app/

Create a new TinyURL using your new link


The link you’re adding to TinyURL should look something like this

https://www.therealworld.ai/?a=pgdbghzm&live=xjxz8xde2lcgij8tyrbh0el4x9ppcdqy

Since your previous TinyURL alias is already taken

Create a brand new one

For example https://tinyurl.com/Wudan-Apprentice will be my new TinyURL

If you used a custom domain follow these steps:

Open https://www.cloudflare.com/

Go to “Rules”


Select “Create Page Rule”

Enter your domain into the URL

Then select “Forwarding URL” as the setting

And select “301 - Permanent Redirect” under select status code

Enter your NEW affiliate link (Link with Tidio enabled) as destination URL

Finish off by selecting “Save and Deploy Page Rule”
