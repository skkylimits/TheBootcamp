# How to get someone to click your link
There are 2 ways, and they vary from platforms to platform.

## TikTok

I recommend you to use both the comments and the description here.

For your description, make it a normal interesting description and then just add a Call To Action to click your link after it.

"Millionaire explains his new money education platform. Tap ðŸ”— in profile to get access"

And as a comment, you just use a CTA and formulate it a little bit different.

"Tap ðŸ”— in profile to get access to this millionaires money education platform"

And then you have your domain/link inside of your TikTok profile.

And remember, this is only possible once you have 1000 followers.

Now, you will realise that I didn't say "link in bio", and that is because you need to understand that TikTok doesn't want you to get people off of their platforms to external links.

There are occurrences where they flag this specific expression and hide your comment, and we just want to avoid it.

Note: 'flagging' means they won't promote this particular video. It won't affect your account as a whole

## Instagram

You you can also use both the comments and the description here, and that's what I recommend.

Description:

"Millionaire explains his new money education platform. Tap ðŸ”— in profile to get access"

Comment:

"Tap ðŸ”— in profile to get access to this millionaires money education platform"

And then you have your domain/link inside of your Instagram profile.

## YouTube
Here you will be putting the link into a comment, that you will also pin.

Your pinned comment will then be like the comment we write for Instagram & TikTok, just that we directly use our link here.

Twitter
Here you will be putting the link into a reply to the video you tweeted.

It can look like the comment you make on YouTube, because you'll give people your link here:
