## What are promo videos
Promo videos are promotional videos that are supposed to make some curious about The Real World and to show them where they can click your affiliate link.

The best types of promotional videos are those where Tate talks about The Real World.

Tate sends those type of videos into the Telegram every now and then, but they are also inside the Tate Library, in the 'Editing Sandbox' folder under 'Past Promos'.

Below is an example of such a clip:

## How to make a promo videos
The way you edit a promo video is like you edit a normal video.

You have a hook, use the superformat and then cut everything in an interesting way.

If you use the new-format, it works just the same way.

Optimal clip length is also 20-40 seconds and you don't need to always use the 'full promo' â€“ but often times you will realise that Tate is keeping someones attention for a longer time and it makes sense to use either the full video or longer parts of the video.

The goal of a promo video isn't necessarily to go viral, obviously it would be the best scenario, but the fundamental goal is to lay it as a trap inside of your profile.

So that when someone likes one of your normal videos, and he scrolls through your other videos, he will stumble across the promotional video.

## How often should you make promos and when?

## Makes sense?
The most important thing is that you get your trust & credibility meter up.

Don't spend it all, and make promotions every day.

80-90% of value. 10-20% of promos.

The more followers you have, the more frequent promos you can make.

Until you have your first 10,000 followers on TikTok, Instagram & YouTube, I would stick to the 10% of promos. (1,000 on Twitter)

And also don't start selling before you even built trust & credibility.

I don't recommend selling before:
- You have 1k followers on TikTok
- 500 on Instagram
- 500 on YouTube
- 100 on Twitter

Because your follower count plays a big role when it comes to buildingTrust & Credibility.

A 100 followers profile that wants to sell me something from the beginning will create the impression that he's 'just in it' for the money.

And I want you to also understand that even though maybe you're still struggling at getting views and don't even have 100 followers yet, that that doesn't mean you're much behind.

It all can happen VERY quickly.

If you upload very high quality content every single day, it only takes one viral video to get you to your first 5,000 followers.

And this one viral video might then start the upwards spiral that makes all your new videos catch momentum, and the algo pushes out your old videos as well.

Just look at my diaries Instagram account (oles-work-diary).

It took 45 videos for the algorithm to push out the first video past the initial 'normal' few hundred views I get.

I'm not concerned about anything, it's largely a game of tenacity and constant hard work, even if I don't see results immediately.

Even if you're stuck at 10 views, it's impossible for it to be that way forever.

You will AT LEAST get one chance to go viral every 7 days, maximum 14 days.

And me, your Squad Leaders and all the other professors are here to make sure that your videos are on top quality when the moment comes where the algo gives them a chance.

The algo can pick any video, but if that video doesn't follow the basics, and all-in-all isn't a good video, then it just won't get results and you might need to wait 7 more days for the coach to give you another chance.

## Promos Make You RICH
So, there's a problem.

Some of you guys have either:
- Consistent 500-1k views on at least one platform
- Over 500 followers on at least one platform

Or even both, but you still don't promote.

You should NOT be afraid of promoting.

If you've got momentum (more views than usual) and post 3 times a day, you can make a promo every 3 days.

Promo video and promo story.

You're not 'tricking' someone, you're not 'selling' them.

You're helping people to make money themselves and you show them what's possible with your promos.

The only reason you should not be posting promos every single day is because it will make you look like you only promote.

It's just a little bit too much.

But if you bombard me with valuable videos and stories every single day, I don't mind you making a promo every 3 days.

Because the promo itself should also not be just you trying to sell them.

It's you showing them success stories and giving them solutions to fix their money problems.

You're inspiring and helping people by doing that.
