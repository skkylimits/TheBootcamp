# The Sales Plan

This is the guide for everyone who is confused about how he should go about sales or if he's even ready to go for sales.

First of all, remember the fundamental skills you're learning.

1) Getting people to know you
2) Getting people to click your link
3) Getting people to buy after clicking your link

This is to key to sales.

If you fail at step 1, then you should not be thinking about sales.

You should FULLY focus on making sure you get views.

How much views is enough? You should get 500 to 1000 views every day.

Once you got that, you can basically start to also focus on sales.

(Note: 'also' because we will FORVER focus on getting more views, and getting better at it.)

Here's how you should go about it:

## Here's how you should go about sales

If you get 500 to 1000 views every single day:
- make a promo video once a week.
- make a promo story once a week
- make a TRW Review video on YT every single day

If you have momentum (momentum = much more views than usual and it's only getting more):
- make a promo video every 3 days
- make a promo video every 3 days
- make a TRW Review video on YT every single day

Bam.

Yes, the sales push isn't there yet.

But that doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't sell.

Your audience is broke, and needs help - help them!
