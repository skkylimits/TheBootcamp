## Why Having Custom Domain Is Important

Why Having Custom Domain Is Important

Having a custom domain that looks professional will increase your trust and credibility

You will get way more sales if they see:

www.wudanapprentice.com

(Especially if your domain matches your username on all social media platforms)

Than if they were to see this:

www.therealworld.ai/?a=pgdbghzm

Having a custom domain is the BEST option

But if you have $0 left to spend and need a completely FREE alternative

My recommendation is https://tinyurl.com/app/

Here you will be able to shorten your affiliate and get something like this:

https://tinyurl.com/WudanApprentice

Both of these options will increase the amount of link clicks you get and boost your sales conversions (help you generate more sales)

## How to Buy A Domain
There are several websites you can use to purchase domains

Personally I prefer to use https://www.domain.com

All domain purchasing websites have very similar settings pages so regardless of your choice you’ll be able to complete all the necessary steps

Our recommendation is to use your brand name as your domain

For example my brand name is @wudanapprentice

So the domain I purchased was www.wudanapprentice.com

It’s best to choose .com for your domain if it’s available

Other decent alternatives are .net, .co.uk, or .org

If your desired domain name is taken

You may include dashes in the name

For example www.wudan-apprentice.com

The use of numbers or excessive dashes is not recommended though

## Connecting Your Domain To Cloudflare
To redirect our custom domain to our affiliate link (you can skip this step if you didn't buy a domain)

And receive a free SSL certificate which will allow our domain to appear as secure on social media platforms

We we will need to connect our domain to Cloudflare

Create an account here https://www.cloudflare.com/

Select the free plan (This is all you will need to follow along)

After that you will add your site to Cloudflare

Go to “DNS” and look for “Cloudflare Nameservers”

Copy paste to replace DNS nameservers from your domain settings

Then make sure to save

Redirecting Your Domain To Your Affiliate Link

Then you will go down to “Rules” (Should appear after adding your site)

Select “Create Page Rule”

Enter your domain into the URL

Then select “Forwarding URL” as the setting

And select “301 - Permanent Redirect” under select status code

Enter your affiliate link as destination URL

Finish off by selecting “Save and Deploy Page Rule”

Your domain should be redirecting to your affiliate link after 48 hours (Often times it takes as little as 30 minutes though)

## What to do with the link?
If you have 1000 followers on TikTok, you can put the link into your bio.

But not in the bio itself, a 'Website' tab right below the field where you can edit your bio will appear then where you can enter it.

If you don't have 1000 followers, don't do anything.

Unless you have 500 followers on Instagram or Twitter, I recommend you to not put the link in there yet. Same for youTube.

We will cover everything regarding selling in detail in the next few days, for now, just make sure you get your domain and connect it to your (Landing Page) affiliate link.
