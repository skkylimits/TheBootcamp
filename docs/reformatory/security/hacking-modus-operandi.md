# Hacking Modus Operandi

The internet is ubiquitous. It has quickly become an essential utility like electricity and water. However, when the internet was built, it was designed with functionality in mind, not security.

These days, with our pervasive digital lives as well as diverse digital governance efforts, we end up sharing a lot of our personal data with several organizations and government institutions. Often, because of a security failure or a deliberate intrusion, this data is exposed to unauthorized actors.

Most people misunderstand how hackers work though.

## You are not the target

Unlike what you’ve seen in the movies, hackers hardly target individuals at first… unless you are a political leader, a prominent government official, or a corporate honcho. Generally, hackers target large organizations or online service with massive userbase and look for security vulnerabilities to breach and steal user data.

Once the cyber criminals have that data dump, they can use it to target individuals, commit financial frauds, or sell that information on dark web. Often the effect might not be immediate, but they will find a way to profit from it via some corrupt means.

## The password bounty

It’s not a secret that common passwords make a hacker’s work easy, and yet that’s the most common way hackers breach accounts and databases. They don’t even have to do it manually. There are simple, automated programs that can enter hundreds of the most common passwords in a minute allowing unauthorized access.

Unfortunately, and luckily for them, 123456 and password are still the most commonly used passwords! Even switching a letter for a symbol – like, p@ssw0rd – doesn’t help because the hackers and the automated programs are aware of this common trick. One needs to avoid single words and common patterns. A long sentence as a password is usually recommended.

Also, reusing the same passwords is a bad, yet very common, habit. So, while your Netflix password gets exposed and you aren’t worried someone can take advantage of your watch history, if you’ve reused the same password for Amazon, it will also reveal your address amongst other information.

An average person has 90 accounts and it is impossible to memorize all those passwords. This is why security experts recommend using a good password manager which makes it easy to generate strong passwords and use a unique one for each account because you don’t have to memorize each one of them.

## It’s not always about money

Many people take breaches less seriously because they associate hacks only with financial fraud. “As long as I don’t use my primary card online or not sign up for one of the fintech apps, I’m good.” Is a fallacy that many believe in.

Hackers do not just care about financial information to swoop in money but have countless ways to leverage other types of personal data for profit. They can use your personal information for identity theft to get new credit card issued in your name or commit a real-world crime implicating you.

In the world we live in, online security is critical, and one must practice good password habits, use adequate precautions online to secure your digital lives, and stay alert to any reports of data breaches or hacks. If your information is exposed in a data breach, here’s what you need to do to avoid any repercussions.

## The five levels of Cybercrime

1.  ***Computer as a tool***- Fraud, identity theft, phishing scams, spam, propagation of illegal material.
2.  ***Computer as a target*** - Viruses, denial of service, malware.
3.  ***Cyberterrorism*** - Government level attacks on foreign intelligence services and governments.
4.  ***Cyberextortion*** - When a system is subjected to or threatened with repeated denial of service, ransomware or other attacks by malicious hackers.
5.  ***Cyberwarfare*** - National-level attacks on other national-level agencies or infrastructure.

Unfortunately, many business owners think of cybercrime as only relating to levels 3, 4 or 5, and disregarding the possibility of their computer being a tool or a target. The statistics and occurrence tell us otherwise. This is like thinking "Robbers only go after big banks and large organisations" when in reality, robbers go after the easy hit, ie a corner shop or local service station.

According to the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), over the 2020--21 financial year, the ACSC received over 67,500 cybercrime reports at a value of A$33 billion, an increase of nearly 13 per cent from the previous financial year. This equates to one report of a cyber-attack every 8 minutes compared to one every 10 minutes last financial year.

The average amounts lost per cybercrime incident are:

-   A$8,899.00 for small businesses
-   A$33,442.00 for medium businesses
-   A$19,306.00 for large businesses

## The common types of cybercrime on small to medium businesses

**Password** -- an attacker attempts to guess your password using automation and technology that can uncover passwords within hours or even minutes.

**Ransomware** -- After accessing your systems and files, an attacker locks your data using encryption then asks for payment to unlock it.

**Malware/viruses** - Malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and is designed to spread from one computer to another.

**Active hacking** -- Automated or manual unauthorised access of a network or data.

**Denial of Service (DoS)**- Rendering a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.

**Social engineering** - A broad range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions, such as a seemingly harmless email with a link to a harmful file or site; or a phone call from a seemingly friendly agency requesting your security details.

**Malicious insider** - Malicious insiders can be employees, former employees, contractors, or business associates who have legitimate access to your systems and data, but use that access to destroy data, steal data or sabotage your systems (intentionally or by mistake).

## Definitions

***Cybercrime*** the term used to describe crimes directed at computers or other information communications technologies and crimes where computers or ICTs are an integral part of an offence.

***Cyber security*** is the practice of defending computers, networks, servers, mobile devices, data from malicious attacks.

***A Cyber-attack*** is an offensive manoeuvre to attempt to expose, alter, disable, destroy, steal or gain information through unauthorised access to or make unauthorised use of an asset.

Cybercrime has evolved into a sophisticated form of destruction and extortion, especially for Small to Medium Businesses (SMB's). This is because cyber criminals have the technology as well as the ways and the means to easily:

-   Seek out and isolate vulnerabilities in internet connected devices
-   Gain illegal access to databases, files and devices
-   Insert malware and obtain information or lock up data for ransom
-   Extort large amounts of money that is untraceable (thanks to Bitcoin and seamless international borders)
