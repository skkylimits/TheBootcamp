## 1.1 | Video Fundamentals

Before you will discover how to make your own videos, we will look at the fundamentals of every good video.

Throughout the 7 steps, you will discover different ways to implement them.

But you should be aware of the 3 most important fundamentals now:
1) Hook
2) Excitement
3) Digestibility

We will look at each of them on the next slides.

## 1) Hook
The hook is the beginning of your video.

And it is the most important part of your video.

A 'good hook' means that the beginning of your video catched my attention and made me interested in watching your video.

That could be Tate saying words that are very attention-grabbing, such as: "And this is the secret to getting rich"

But there are also other ways of doing it such as placing a text on your video that says: "Tate on Getting Rich Secrets"

We will teach you all the different ways and tricks of doing it.

But it's important to understand that the hook is the most important part of your video.

Because if the beginning of your video doesn't make me interested in watching your video, then NOTHING ELSE matters.

You could have the PERFECT video, something truly amazing might happen at second 0:20, but if you lost me at second 0:05, then it doesn't matter.

Short-form content is a fight for attention.

And the beginning is always the most important bit.

A videos hook are overall the first 0-5 seconds, but from second 0, your potential viewer is already debating if your video is worth watching or if it makes more sense to look at some girls or entertainment stuff.

And he might already leave after second 1 if he's bored.

So, the first step of a good video is a good hook that grabs attention.

The second step is keeping attention.


## 2) Excitement
If you want to keep my attention, you can't bore me.

You can't make me think that:
- I've seen this before
- I know what's going to happen
- I don't think this is important for me

Remember,

Short-form content is a fight for attention.

At every single second of your video, your viewers are debating whether the next video is more interesting than the one they watch right now.

You're always just one swipe away from losing them.

Therefore you CANNOT bore your viewers.

You need to:
- Cut out all pauses
- Cut out all repetitions
- Cut out everything that distracts from the main point of your video.

The Main Point of a Video:
This means that if Tate is sharing the secrets to getting rich, a comment from the interviewer can be cut out. Or once Tate made his final point and the conversation goes into another topic, the video is cut off.

You just need to make sure that your viewers are ALWAYS excited to keep watching. Your video needs to be a rollercoaster that's only going up.

There's only NEW stuff coming.

And by doing that, you keep the attention.

Now,

I know that's a lot of theory and you have no idea how to implement all that yet.

But it's important having those fundamentals in mind/heard first.

Trust me, it's only one slide of boring-theory-(but very IMPORTANT)-fundamentals left until we go into ACTION!

## 3) Digestibility
This is a very simple principle.

It's about making your video easy to digest:
- Easy to read subtitles
- Good quality footage
- Pleasant music-to-speech ration

Those are all ways to making sure that your viewers have an easy and enjoyable time digesting the information of your video.

You do not want your viewers to spend BRAIN CALORIES.

If your subtitles are hard to read, if the music is uncomfortably loud, then I need to CONCENTRATE to digest the information of the video.

Concentrating means that I need to spend brain calories (takes effort).

Problem is,

The majority of our viewers don't have many brain calories and they don't want to spend them.

If they realise that it will take effort to digest your video, they'll bounce.

You can already lose someone within less than 1 second because of that.

## Time for ACTION
Those were the 3 fundamentals that you will always find in good videos.

1) Hook
2) Excitement
3) Digestibility

NEVER FORGET THEM.

Now it's time to go intro practise, on the next slide Alex will teach you Editing Mastery.
