## Chat GPT - Hooks

The way we want to use Chat GPT for our hooks is by giving it a fundamental idea to work with, and then making it give us variations of that which are maximum 5 words long.

(Maximum 5 words because our hook can't be too long.)

Here's an example prompt:

'Give me 10 variations of this hook:

"Billionaire Reveals Key Element To His Success"

And make it maximum 5 words long.'

You see, me initial hook was longer than 5 words itself, so it can even shorten your 'long ideas'.

But here are 5 of the 10 variations it gave me:

1. "Billionaire's Success Key Revealed"
2. "The Billionaire's Success Ingredient"
3. "Billionaire's Secret Success Factor"
4. "Billionaire's Success Key Discovered"
5. "The Billionaire's Success Blueprint"

They're actually not bad.

I like 3) the most.

"Billionaire's Secret Success Factor"

But let's break the benefits down and make sure know how to leverage this tool best in our daily workflow.

1) By doing this exercise you will be able to generate different variations of your own idea and come up with better ones.

As I inserted: "Billionaire's Secret Success Factor" into the AI, it now gave me more variations.

One of them is: "Billionaire's Success Recipe" which I find even better because of the 'recipe' idea – which makes it sound like: Just do this and you will win.

But as we don't want the AI to do all the work for us, and our thinking is still required, I'd add 'Secret' this this example to round it up.

"Billionaire's Secret Success Recipe".

Boom. That's my hook now.

I generated alternatives and looked for better ideas to play with.

I went from 'the key element' to the 'secret recipe'.

And this ties into 2) as well.

2) By doing this exercise you will learn more ways to write hooks in general.

I'm not sure how many of you already implemented the 'secret recipe' or the 'secret success factor' in your hooks.

It's a new idea you can use now.

## Chat GPT - Descriptions

I don't consider this tool as useful for descriptions as it is for hooks.

It's not VERY good here, but I'll still show you how you can use it.

I'd only use it for some inspiration in terms of ideas.

Example:

'Give me 5 variations for this sentence that is meant to convince someone to watch my video:

"This will allow you to replicate this billionaires success."'

Answer:

1. "Find out how to replicate the billionaire's success in this video."
2. "Discover the secret to achieving billionaire success in this video."
3. "Get the insider knowledge on how to achieve billionaire success with this video."
4. "Learn from a billionaire's own experience and replicate their success."
5. "Unlock the key to billionaire success with this video."

Those descriptions aren't very good in my opinion as it takes a long time to 'get to the point', but you can steal some ideas if there are interesting ones.

For example, I like idea 3) – getting 'insider knowledge'.

I'd rewrite my original description by making it:

"⚠️ INSIDER KNOWLEDGE. This will allow you to replicate this billionaires success."

I stole the idea. See?

That's how I'd use Chat GPT to improve my descriptions.

## Chat GPT - Comments

You need to lead with a good idea here as well.

But Chat GPT can really help you in coming up with better ways to formulate questions & statements here.

Example:

'Give me 5 variations of this question which is meant to make someone reply:

"Do you think the man arguing with the billionaire is right? Personally I disagree, I think he made it up to feel better about him failing."'

Answer:

1. "What's your opinion on the man's argument with the billionaire? Do you agree or disagree?"
2. "Do you think the man's perspective is accurate, or do you believe he is making it up?"
3. "Is the man's argument with the billionaire valid in your opinion, or do you disagree?"
4. "Do you agree with the man's view, or do you think he is fabricating it to feel better about his own failure?"
5. "What are your thoughts on the man's argument with the billionaire? Do you think it has merit, or do you disagree?"

I'd not copy & paste any of these. For some reason he left my personal statement away, and I'm not 100% happy with them.

But that's fine.

Chat GPT isn't supposed to do the work for us, it's supposed to help us.

And comment 2) for example has a way to formulate the question that I like very much.

"Do you think the man's perspective is accurate, or do you believe he is making it up?"

I'll replace my own question with that, and then add my personal statement at the end.

"Do you think the man's perspective is accurate, or do you believe he is making it up? I think he made it up to feel better about him being a loser.".

But you can also make Chat GPT help you in coming up with a provoking statement.

Example:

'Give me 5 variations of this statement which is meant to make someone reply:

"What an outrageous lie. He obviously made it up."'

Answer:

1. "I can't believe he would make up such a ridiculous lie."
2. "That has got to be one of the most outrageous lies I've ever heard."
3. "I think it's clear that he's just making things up."
4. "That's such an obvious fabrication – it's outrageous."
5. "I don't believe a word of it – it's clearly just a made-up lie."

I find them even better than my own version.

2) and 5) are killers.

"That has got to be one of the most outrageous lies I've ever heard."
"I don't believe a word of it – it's clearly just a made-up lie."

I would probably pick one of them.
