## Welcome To Chat GPT

You will now learn how you can use 'Chat GPT' to help you come up with hooks, comments and descriptions.

The way it works is that you give the tool an idea to work with, and it will then build onto that.

Example:

'Give me variations of this hook that are maximum 5 words long:

"Billionaire Reveals His Secret Money Mindset"'

Answer:

"Billionaire's secret money mindset exposed"
"Unlock the wealthy's secret money strategies"
"Discover the millionaire mindset"
"The secret money mindset of the rich"
"Billionaire's wealth secrets revealed"

We will go through specific examples for comments, descriptions and hooks later, but this AI tool has 2 main advantages for you:

1) It can help you come up with better hooks/descriptions/comments
2) It can give you new ideas on how to write better hooks/descriptions/comments as a whole

Chat GPT won't replace out thinking. But we will use it as a tool that can HELP us in coming up with better ideas.

But before we go into the details... Let me show you how you can get access to the tool.

If you already used DALEE, then you can click on 'Log In' button, because the account you created for DALEE was created on the same platform (openai.com).

Otherwise, click on the 'Sign Up' button and create an account.

You are now ready to type your prompts and I will walk about through everything over the next slides.

You will write your prompts into the the input field at the very bottom.
