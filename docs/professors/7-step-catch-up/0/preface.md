Welcome to the 7 Step Catch-Up!

This is a 7 step program that is designed to not only get you onto the level of those who started before you, but also to give you everything you need to make your first sale as soon as possible.

It is meant to be completed within 7 days, but it's not easy. Depending on how time you have available per day, it might take you up to 14 days.

Which would be fine, you should not skip a single step here. Not even a single word.

EVERYTHING is crucial.

After all, this is a Bootcamp & you're now able to prove yourself as part of Tate's Team.

Make the most out of that opportunity; follow the lessons, ask good questions AND (most importantly) make A LOT of money for yourself!

Good luck!

## Account Creation (! read carefully before you do anything)

Today we are going to create an account on all major social media platforms but we are NOT going to post anything, nor will we change our usernames.

We will do this later together with specific instructions.

Now we just want our account to be 'warmed-up' and ready for when that happens.

A big reason why people are struggling on new social media accounts is because their account is seen as spam by the respective platform.

Therefore we want to create an account now, and we also want to spend a few minutes a day engaging with content on that account, so we aren't perceived as a 'spammer' who just came to upload but as a real human.

And we also want to make sure we have any VPN's turned off as they can make us look like spammers too.

- Create an account (do not change anything)
- Engage a few minutes with content
- VPN turned off

Create an account on the following platforms:

- Instagram
- YouTube
- TikTok

When you engage with content, engage with #mindset videos or something similar so your ForYouPage isn't contaminated with haram videos.

And again, do not change your username yet!
On Instagram you will need to select a username to get started, but do not change it yet. The name you have now doesn't matter. We we will change everything later together.
