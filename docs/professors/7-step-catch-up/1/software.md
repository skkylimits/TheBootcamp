## Using Your Editing Software

You can basically use any editing software, but there are 2 programs that we recommend and that our tutorials will be based on.

- CapCut (phone) [free]
- Premiere Pro (PC/Mac) [$20/month]

If you have a PC/Mac and you don't mind paying for a software, we recommend you to use Premiere Pro as it on average will allow you to get the work done faster.

(We do NOT encourage you to illegally download this software. Anyone sharing cracked download links in the chats will be banned without a warning.)

Using CapCut on the phone is perfectly fine and you will be able to produce videos of the same quality. Plus, you have the advantage of being able to make videos from anywhere.

It can also come in handy to learn both programs so you're very flexible, but we recommend you to now pick one of the 2 programs and master that one first.
