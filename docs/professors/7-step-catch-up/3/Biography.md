How to write a good bio:

It's very simple. In a good bio, you try to answer at least 2 of these 3 questions:

- Who are you?
- Why do you exist?
- What can you do for me (as a viewer)?

Good Examples:

3/5
We went through 100's of hours of Tate content.
Access his most inspiring speeches curated into 20 seconds videos.

If's fine to copy those bios, but I I recommend you to still change words and give them your own spin.

The idea is very simple.

Just make sure it's all congruent, genuine and it answer 2 of those 3 questions.

- Who are you?
- Why do you exist?
- What can you do for me (as a viewer)?
