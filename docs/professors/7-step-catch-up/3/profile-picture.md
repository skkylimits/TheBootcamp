But before we go into the tutorial, there are 3 rules of a good profile picture that you need to keep in mind:

1) Try to balance it out between 50% light, 50% dark.
2) Make it easy to digest. Avoid fancy stuff or lots of details. Keep it simple.
3) Try to make the symbols you pick related to your brand, if your name has Cobra in it, then a Cobra symbol can work very well.
