## The right way

Before you go ahead and post your video, here are a few warnings:

1 Don't post a video on TikTok that shows Tates face

TikTok currently uses facial recognition to automatically ban Tate content. Even though we created an account together, we won't really use it for now.

Once you finished the 7 steps, you will discover a ways to 'trick the algorithm'. But for now it's more important to focus on Instagram and YouTube as platforms.

2 Turn off your VPN if you are using one

You don't want to be seen as a bot. Using a VPN increases the risk of being seen as on massively.

3 Make sure your account is older than 24 hours and you spend some time engaging with content.

This is also to make sure you're not seen as a bot.

If you can check off all those 3 warnings, then you will find out about the usage of hashtags and video descriptions on the next slide so we can finally post our first video.
