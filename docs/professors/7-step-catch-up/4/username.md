# 3.0 | Your Username

Now you will create your own brand.

And it all starts with your username, which is something very important.

There is one easy method to come up with a good username, and that's doing a "Word + Word combination".

For example:

- Tate + word
- Cobra + word
- Morpheus + word
(And the other way around of course)

Examples for the words are:

- motivation
- scholar
- rise

The goal is to make sure that the person who reads your account name will have some idea of what your account will be about.

Examples:
"tatemotivation" - this seems to be an account that posts Tate content ('tate') that is motivational ('motivation').

"taterise" - this seems to be about rising ('rise') and Tate ('tate'), I'll probably see Tate content that helps me rise.

"cobrascholar" - this seems to be about Tate content ('tate') and learning ('scholar'), I might learn how to be like Tate.

You can also play with word endings:

- Tate + ism
- Cobra + ce
- Morpheus + y

Here you just try to give one specific word a spin and make it sound somehow cool.
