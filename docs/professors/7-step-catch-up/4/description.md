# 4.2 | Description

All the platforms that we are attacking give us the ability to use hashtags and add a description to our video ("Title" on YouTube).

What do I put into the description?
You can use your description as a second written hook.

At step 5 you will learn a new way of writing hooks that will help you here, but for now you can just put your normal hook into the description.

On YouTube there's no such thing as a description for the Shorts video we post, we only have a Title; make your Title your hook.
