# 4.3 | Hastags

## Should I use hashtags?

You can use them.

TikTok, Instagram and YouTube use hashtags to find the perfect audience to show your videos to.

However, hashtags aren't mandatory and they aren't required to go viral, but they can help a lot at the very beginning of an account.

Helping in breaking a low-view barrier because the platform knows who the right audience is.

If you want to use hashtags, our strategy is on the next slide.

## Here's the hashtag strategy we recommend you to use

- Use 3 hashtags that perfectly match the topic of your video.
- Use big hashtags with a lot of views/videos.

On Instagram & YouTube, you can use the "#andrewtate" hashtag.

E.g. #andrewtate #mindset #motivation

On TikTok, you want to avoid any 'Tate' hashtags because they're currently banned.

Important: When you use hashtags, make sure that your video fits perfectly into the videos that are going viral under the hashtag. Take the 1-2 minutes to look at the hashtags you plan on using. This is important in making sure your videos are shown to the right audience.
