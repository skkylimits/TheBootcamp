There are 3 methods to finding clips

1) Interview Method
2) Library Method
3) Inspiration Method

We will look at each of these methods now.

## 1) Interview Method - Listen to this first

## 1.1) Interview Method - Further Explained

With this method, you listen to a Tate interview and make notes of all possible clips.

How to do that:

1) Watch an interview
2) Open a notes document, or a spreadsheet in the background
3) Whenever you come across something was interesting/funny/etc., write it down in your document/spreedsheet

Example:
0:40 - 1:12 Tate gives advice on how to approach girls. GREAT CLIP
3:40 - 5:12 Tate explains how to deal with a breakup. Good clip

We add titles to every timestamps so we know what the clip was about.

How to use those clips?
Just screen record the clip you want to use via your phone or PC. Then import it into Premiere Pro / CapCut to edit it.

Where do I find interviews?

- Inside the "Daily Interview" section in the Learning Center, we will post one interview per day.
- But you can also just look for "Andrew Tate Interview" on YouTube.
- Or find all interviews inside the "Tate Library".

You will discover what the Tate Library is on the next slide.

## 2) Library Method

We have a library for you where every single Tate interview that was ever made is collected and timestamped.

You can gain access to it with this link:

How to use it is explained in the video below:

## 3) Inspiration Method

With this method you purposefully look for Tate content online that has already went viral and you try to replicate it.

This method can work very well, especially if a video went viral a few months ago and people have already forgot about it.

However, this method very much requires you to be familiar with Tate content already so you know from which interview which clip is.
