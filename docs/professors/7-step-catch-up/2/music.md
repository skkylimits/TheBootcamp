Music comes down to one thing and that's ENERGY.

It amplifies the energy of a video.

A speech that motivates you will motivate you even more if it has good music on it.

The same thing with a speech that hits you deep & makes you think, it will hit you much harder if it has good music on it.

But what is good music?

That depends on each clip. A song that perfectly fits to one clip may feel completely off at another clip.

Trial & Error is a big thing when it comes to music.

## Practical Example 1/2

Below you will find a clip where I switched the music 3 times.

You will realise how each song completely changes the energy of the speech.

## Practical Example 2/2

The skill of music choice is recognising:

- The energy of the speech
- The energy of the music

And then combining both in a way where the end-product has more energy than the video had before.

Each of the 3 things changed the energy and increased it.

Personally, the last song matched the video best because this speech has a conspiracy vibe, and the music has one too, so they match very well.

But that's just my opinion.

The lessons you should take away from this is:

Music is an amplifier. Try different songs out until you have an end-product that has more energy than the original.

The music-speech combination should also be very pleasant.

Your greatest weapon here is again:

You.

If you're honest with yourself, you will realise when the music matches and when it doesn't reeaaally match.

But it's a trial and error game.

## Keep this in mind when using music

The music can't distract from the video.

Don't make it so loud that I need to concentrate to be able to hear the speech.
(Digestibility! - Don't make me spend brain calories)

And also don't make it too quiet so I can't hear it.

Good music doesn't distract from the speech, but is still loud enough for me to hear it. I don't actively notice it.

Trial & error is again the key for finding that volume.

Extra Note:

The Music usually sounds louder on headphones than it sounds on speakers. But most people watch your videos with speakers.

So if you use headphones while editing, try to double check the volume by listening to your video with speakers.
