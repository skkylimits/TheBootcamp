# 2.1 | Clip Selection

This will teach you what kind of clips you should pick for your videos.

Your clip is the most important part of your video, it's the essence.

But it's not that hard to find good clips, it all comes down to:

"What's interesting and entertaining?"

That's it.

And the easiest way to find out the answer is to just look at yourself.

You are your greatest clip selection weapon.

Was there a speech from Tate that you found extremely inspiring, that might even have changed your life?

Or a clip that you found ridiculously funny and had to watch 2-3 times?

Those are most likely good clips.

If you found something interesting or funny, you're probably not alone and other people will like it too â€“ Boom, a good clip!

## Biggest Clip Selection Mistake

People who struggle with selecting clips usually either:

1) Overthink the process
2) Approach the process disingenuously.

Problem 1) Overthinking the process:
If you found something interesting, then that's the time to take the clip and edit it.

Yes, there are 10,000 other clips. There will be clips that are 'better'.

But you will come across them eventually, they don't run away.

Remember,

SPEED.

You'll have much better results using all the 'good clips' than spending time finding the clips that are 'slightly better'.

Don't overthink it.

You got something good? Use it.

Trust me, majority of clips that blow up are just good clips, nothing extremely special.

Problem 2) Approaching the process disingenuously:
Don't pick clips 'just to pick a clip'.

Pick clips because you found them interesting, helpful or funny.

Be genuine about it. And it's even better if the clips make you think:

"Nice, this is a clip that I'm sure will help my followers."

Don't pick clips just because you 'need to pick' them.

Pick them because they somehow add value to someones life.

What is the perfect clip-length?

There are 3 kinds of clip lengths:

- Short length (0-15 seconds)
- Mid length (15 - 30 seconds)
- Long length (30 seconds +)

I recommend to stick with clips in the mid range.

Social media platforms care about how long you can keep people on their platform.

With a long video, it's very easy to farm a lot of watch-time, but it's also harder to keep their attention.

With short videos, it's easy to keep their attention, but hard to farm watch-time.

Mid length videos combine the best of both worlds.

Short clips can work, long clips can work.

It's just a little bit harder to make them work which is why generally I recommend mid-length clips.
