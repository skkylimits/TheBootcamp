# Clip Selection

## What makes good clips?
- Life-changing
- Entertaining

## Where do I find clips?
- Tate Library (search for a keyword, look at the description; if description is interesting, watch clip; if clip is interesting, pick click; otherwise, continue searching)
- Brand New Interviews
- Old TateSpeeches on Odysee

## What's the perfect Clip length?
- 20-40 seconds

## -- Checklist --

- Did I watch this clip for at least 20 seconds?
- Does it fall into one of the 2 categories?

If in the 'life-changing' category:
- Does having the information the clip provides offer an advantage to my life?
- Can I practically implement the information I learned?
- Would I send it to a friend?

If in the 'entertainment' category:
- Was this interesting or funny?
- Did it just 'hooked' me in like a good TV show does?
- Would I send this to a friend?

If you can hit at least one of these checks, you're on the right track.

## AND REMEMBER

### VIDEO

Timestamp your videos in spreadsheets

Every clip that I timestamped is something I would post.

What makes me post those clips? I simply found them interesting.

That's it. Don't overthink it.

Just enjoy the interview, and take note of all the interesting things.

(Which can by the way be many. You can end up with 50+ clips from one interview.
