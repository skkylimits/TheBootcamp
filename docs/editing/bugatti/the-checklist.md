# The Checklist

1) Are my hooks & subtitles in the right place?
2) Does the hook make me curious about what happens next?
3) Does the description help in making me interested in the video?
4) Can I read the subtitles when the video is muted?
5) Are the subtitles in the right place?
6) Can I easily hear Tate over the music without looking at the video?
7) Is the hook fully read before subtitles appear?
8) No repeated sentences in the video

Go through this after you finished editing a video, every single time.

And for point 8) 'No repeated sentences in the video' â€“ Luc once made a special lesson for you on this here:
