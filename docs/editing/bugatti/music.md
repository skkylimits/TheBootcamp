# How to select music & determine the vibe of a video?

It’s quite simple.

You use deep/'sad' music when Tate is talking about something deep.

You use motivational, energetic music when Tate is giving an energetic motivational speech.

The vibe you get from the music need to be similar to the vibe you get from the speech.

Here's how you determine the vibe:

### 1. Determine the topic of the video

Examples: be more brave, stand up for yourself, think more about money, get your shit together.

### 2. Listen to music seperately and think:

"Would I think about the topic of the video while listening to this song"

Example: You would not plan world-conquest with Lo-Fi music in the background. And you would not think deeply about what you want in life with heavy-metal in the background.

### 3. Find the best matching song

Listen to different music tracks and pick the best ones.

Put them under your video and test out what fits best.

Don't waste any time here.

If you can't find the 'perfect track' after 5-10 minutes, just pick the one that fits best and move on.

The music finding process will become much faster over time.

Now, the key to being able to say:

"This one fits better"

is obviously having a big library withs good songs.

## Music Library

We have a pre-made music library for you.

You can get access to it through the music-library channel inside The Real World.

It's structured like this:
- General music
- Energetic music
- Deep music

General music is everything AND stuff that doesn't REALLY match one of the other 2 categories.

Energetic music is everything that gives me energy.

Deep music is everything that just hits deep and makes you think deep, reflect on life etc.

Here's how to use this Music Library.

## Nuances

You need to make sure that the music is just the cherry on the cake.

I can't distract from the video itself.

So, there are 2 important things to note:

1) There shouldn't be lyrics and voices in the music you pick – that can easily distract from Tate's words.

2) The music volume can't be too loud, because then we can't hear Tate talk anymore.

Also, it's best to adjust the volume of the music on the speakers.

The sound is different when you edit stuff with headphones vs. without and as post people watch TikToks with their speakers, we want to have it optimised for that.

## Music changes your emotional state

The sole reason people love to listen to music is because it makes them feel a certain way.

Look at a clubs.

Imagine there was no music.

It would be an ENTIRELY different experience.

You ever worked out with music in the background and remember how the music helped you to push harder?

There's a reason why ancient armies went into war with war drums in the background.

The drums were used in war to keep a cadence so the soldiers stayed in step.

Music hypnotises people.

Its used to help solidiers with important battles.

Make it that they don't worry so much and are genuinely excited to charge into battle.

Even in WW2, in army camps, factories and hospitals, music was blaring from the radio helping to lift the spirits of soldiers every day.

So there's a reason we teach you guys music in such great details here.

Music can make it more pleasant for people to listen to the video.

But it can also help in getting the message accross, it can help a 'deep message' to really get into peoples head.

The deep music already puts their brains into the 'deep mood', they're open for the deep message now and it will hit much harder than if there was no music, or hard rock music in the background.

Same thing for motivational speeches that give you energy and motivation.

Having music in the background that gives you energy, and that makes you want to conquer already puts your brain into the right mood.

When they now hear Tate's words in combination with it, it will leave a much greater impact on them as if there was no music.

It's like digging a hole into dirt.

You could just take the shovel and start digging.

Will work, no problem.

But if you were to wet the area with water before digging, it will be MUCH easier than if you were to just start digging at random.

Now it's just mud.

No solid, tough ground.

Just wet, soft mud.

Music is the water in this analogy.

Makes it easier to dig – makes it easier to get the message in.

The skill is to find music that matches the vibe of the video so it can wet their emotional state.

## Practical Exercise

Take a clip.

At best a clip that's one of your favourites.

Look at the clip closely and observe the vibe.

On the spectrum of moods, from:

Super Deep –– Pure Energy

Where would you put this clip?

Capture the vibe of the clip, really capture the vibe & feeling you get from it.

You now need to find a song that matches the vibe & feeling as close as possible, at best it matches it close to EXACTLY.

Do this excercise conciously.

You need to do it with 100% of your energy.

Really needs to be a concious process of you sitting down observing the vibe of the clip and looking for a song that matches this vibe.

You need to do this every single time when you select music.

Every. Single. Time.

Otherwise you'll end up with random music, and this will bleed through to your audience.

## How to find music outside of the Library

You can save what you like.

Everytime you happen to come across a song that you think could match your video, save it.

'Save it' means in my case to look for the song on YouTube, then to download it with loader.to as a .mp3 so I can use it in my editing program.

If I find a nice song on TikTok, I will use Shazam to find out the name of the song.

'Shazam' is an App that allows you to find the name of songs. Sometimes it also works when the music is playing in the background of the video. It doesn't recognise EVERYTHING – but a lot.

Going down rabbitholes:

Create a YouTube account and take advantage of the algo.

Look at creators that upload good music that you can use for TikTok:
- Really Slow Motion
- Zack Hemsey
- Ninja Tracks

Or just type in the name of songs you liked.

And go through the songs of the creators, and leverage the 'Recommended' section to find new ones that fit and make sense.

It may take 15-20 tries to find something that works as background music for TikTok, but they have a lot of hidden gems.

It's not an efficient method, but it can lead to finding new unique tracks.

YouTube Search function

"Emotional Music"
"Motivational Music"
"War Drums Music"

Be blunt about that. Sometimes you're lucky and YouTube gives you EXACTLY what you're looking for.
