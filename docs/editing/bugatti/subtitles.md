# Subtiles

Today's lesson is about the making it that our videos are easy for people to digest.

You'll learn about:
- Where to place your subtitles
- How to size your subtitles

## Subtitle Placement

When it comes to subtitle placement, there are 3 important things you need to keep in mind:

1. Subtitles need be in placement zones
2. Subtitles need to be close to Tate's head
3. Subtitles can't be on Tate's mouth

## 1. Subtitles need be in placement zones

Just like you can see it in the picture here.

Subtitles should NEVER be below the middle of the screen – which means below the red field.

## 2. Subtitles need to be close to Tate's head

When I watch a video, I pay attention to two things:
- The person speaking
- The subtitles

The reason we want to have the subtitles close to Tate's face is because otherwise my attention is shifting from face -> subtitles -> face -> ...

It's annoying for the brain. It costs brain calories to shift my focus all the time.

And TikTokers don't have many brain calories, so we need to make it as easy as possible that they can pay attention to both Tate speaking and the subtitles.

If you look at the example below, you'll realise the subtitles are very close to Tate's face which makes it easy to focus on him speaking + subtitles.

## 3. Subtitles can't be on Tate's mouth

Now, when we put our subtitles close to Tate's face, something that you need to AVOID is that they can't cover Tate's mouth.

That's a NO-GO!

People want to see him speaking, they want to see his mouth.

The best thing is to have them close to his chin, below the mouth.

Exceptions:

In cases where Tate's head takes up the entire screen and it's nearly impossible to have them below his mouth, then you just put them between eyes and mouth on his nose.

But note that as a general rule:

= Subtitles should NEVER cover his mouth, and always be BELOW his mouth.

The only exception is when having subtitles below his mouth means that they wouldn't be inside the red placement zones anymore, then you can put them in the middle of his nose.

Below is an example picture of how to deal with such an exception:

## How to size your subtitles

For now, stick with the sizing Alex' showed you.

Font sizing is all about being easy and pleasant to read.

Can't be too big, can't be too tiny.

Is there 'the perfect size'? No.

But the sizing Alex' showed you is as close as it gets to it.

You can also take inspiration from me once I start posting or from your Squad Leaders, but for now – stick with Alex sizing.

There's a reason he picked the size he picked and not another size.

As we progress in the Bootcamp, you guys will learn how to experiment and deviate from the example Alex gave you, but now is not the time for that.

I just want to make sure you guys don't deviate from Alex' sizing, because BIG and TINY subtitles can ruin the viewing experience.

Just imagine the font on your screen was triple the size, it would be a pain to read it.

Or imagine it was 3x tinier, you would have to focus hard to read it.

Therefore, stick with Alex' sizing for now.

Tomorrow you guys will learn A LOT and I'll show you how to go about posting.

There's another time for when we give everything a very unique touch, for now, make sure you understood today's lesson & the prior ones, and you complete your daily assignment.

Tomorrow the action begins.
