#  Wash your car
We will look:
1) What 'washing your car' means and why you need to do it
2) How to wash your car.

Let's start with 1) by listening to Luc's lecture below:

Wash the car

## How To Wash Your Car
Is many places where dirt is hiding.

3 big ones are:
- Superformat and Stock footage clips
- Motion Tracking
- Cuts

## Superformat and Stock footage clips
There are better clips to pick.

Be honest.

There are moments where Tate is talking about a subject, and you know a clip that is connected to the subject would fit best and the one you have right no doesn't REALLY match.

You know there are better ones.

But you don't have a better one in front of you, and you'd need to go look for one in the Library, Telegram or on YouTube.

Would take you 2-10 minutes, and you think it's not worth the effort.

But it is. People will see it.

Even if you need to look 10 minutes for every clip in your video, you NOW have those clips.

You can reuse them in other videos.

Finding new stock footage clips also helps you in the long run.

Now, back to the problem.

You can pick better stock footages.

Good matching stock footages make the video more enjoyable and lead to higher watch time.

And you can pick better superformat covers.

They're IMPORTANT.

It's ALWAYS worth to take the extra minutes to find a GOOD superformat cover clip.

The first 3-5 seconds are the most important ones.

If you fail there, no one will ever watch your video and nothing else matters.

## Motion Tracking
You're skipping frames.

When you motion track your subtitles, you SEE that there are frames where the subtitles are completely off.

But it's just 'a few frames' so you don't fix it up.

Would take you 1-5 minutes MAX to fix all these moments.

But you don't do it.

And that's your problem.

Everyone sees it.

Now they'll either think you're lazy because you saw it and didn't fixed it.

Or that you're not that clever because you didn't see it.

Lose - lose.

Make sure there are no frames where your motion tracking is off.

Take the extra minutes.

## The Final Review
Do you look at your videos after you exported them once again, and very carefully?

You should.

And when you realise something doesn't flow, that there's a typo, that the motion tracking is off, that there's a better clip to pick... Then you need to fix it.

It bleeds through in your work, and it will reflect in your results.

When you genuinely try to make every video one of your best videos, people will see it.

Most likely subconsciously, but sometimes consciously â€“ they will see that your videos have little to no flaws and provide them with a Bugatti viewing experience.
