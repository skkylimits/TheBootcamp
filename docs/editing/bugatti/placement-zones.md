# Placement Zones

Today's lesson is about the making it that our videos are easy for people to digest.

You'll learn about:
- Human's primary field of focus

## Human's primary field of focus

Look at the image on the right side.

(If you're on the phone, it's the image on the top)

The red zone is where my eyes naturally look at.

The action always needs to happen there.

How can I implement this in my video?

Make sure that Tate's head is always in the red zone.

And also make sure that your subtitles are always in the red zone (more details in the next slides).

Sometimes you will have videos where you need to zoom in and adjust the position of the video so Tate's head is in the red zone â€“ that's fine.

Do the zooms. Do the adjustments.

No one wants to look at the bottom of the screen, it's painful and unnatural.
