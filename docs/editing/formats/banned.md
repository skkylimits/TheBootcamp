# Banned

The new format is made to target the removals/ban issue many of you are facing on TikTok.

It's specifically for those who struggle with the bans and removals, but it's also something that those of you can take advantage of who don't struggle with removals or bans.

So, when it comes to using the new format, you're in one of 2 scenarios:
1) You heavily struggle with violations and bans
2) You don't struggle with violations and bans (or only slightly)

I will walk you through how to implement this format based on which one you are now:

1) You struggle with violations and bans

You will implement this format on a new account.

Step 1:
But before you create it, I recommend you to log-out of those accounts that are heavily affected by strikes/violations.

This is going to be a hard-cut, resulting in a fresh start.

If you don't want to abandon your old accounts, no problem. Then continue with scenario 2). Because this part is for those that are getting striked to death, and are happy to start fresh.

Step2:
Now, after you logged out of your accounts, create the new account with a new IP address.

How to get a new IP address? Either:
- Call your Internet Service Provider and ask them to reset it.
- Restart your Router
- Use mobile data and activate & deactivate airplane mode to get a new IP.

I recommend it for a fresh start.

Step 3)
Use a completely new email. If you can't add a phone number, that's fine.

Step 4)
When creating a username, I allow you to create a new brand name.

If you picked a name you didn't like, and you didn't really had much success on other platforms and your brand name isn't known yet, then this a rare moment where it's okay to make a complete fresh start.

But if you liked your brand name or already have an audience that knows you on other platforms, then you will select a similar username to the one you have now.

Normal = jasperquasar

New usernames could be:
jasper.qusar
jasper_quasar
jasperquasarr
jasper.quasarr
jasper_quasarr

Just something similar.

To give you a rule of thumb, if I had less than 500 followers in total across Twitter, YouTube and Instagram, I would create a new brand name and change my name on these platforms UNLESS I'm totally happy with it.

If you need to wait 14 days until you can change the name, I'd continue as usual on the account and then change it.

Step 5)
Wait 24h until you make your first post. And once you discover how the format actually looks like, make completely NEW videos with it.

You will be attacking your normal Instagram, and your normal YouTube account now with these kind of videos.

2) You don't struggle with violations and bans (or only slightly)

You are in a position where you CAN use the new format on a new account as a 'safe account' or a 'backup account'.

Personally, I am going to do this. It's not necessary, but it can help you in being protected.

If you decide to do it, you will not create entirely new videos, you are going to use the 'normal videos' you post, and recreate them in a new format way – which you will learn how to do later on.

Now, if you decide to go this route, here's what to do.

Step 1:
Create a new account on your phone. No need to change IP address or anything, just use a fresh email to create this account. Phone number isn't necessary.

Step 2:
Find a new username.

We don't want our main to be banned and then allow haters to search for out backup account.

So, turn back to Day 7 where we created our usernames, and think of something cool.

You will need a new profile picture and bio here as well – but can of course use your main bio as inspiration.

Step 3:
Create new accounts on other socials with the same new username.

You can post the same Tweets and the same stories you post on your main account, but change them slightly.

Change a word in your Tweets. And change the length, music or words inside the story.

You don't NEED to do stories & tweets, but if you have enough time, I recommend you to do it.

Step 4)
Wait 24h until you make your first post.

I know some of you who will run this as a second account will be unsure how this new account impacts the daily assignments and your workload:

I will go into this later again, but 2 new format videos will count as 1 normal video.

So, you are free to make 2 normal videos, and recreate them as 2 new format videos and it will count as 3 videos in total.


But now, let me actually show you the format.

## How to use the format
We are using stock footages here.

Stock footages = videos recorded by other people.

(You will get resources to where to find these footages later on.)

And that is the goal of the new format:

We only have Tate's voice, but we don't see him.

NNow, when it comes to this format, there are 3 rules:

1) Footages need to match what's being said

ATate talks about London? Show them the Big Ben, the bridge or something London related.
Tate talks about driving a fast car? Show a fast car.
Tate talks about a restaurant? Show a restaurant.

Just like I did in the example video.

The background footages NEED to make sense and be connected to the topic so the video is enjoyable to watch.

If you can't think of anything that matches, then use landscape footages.

Oceanas, Forests, Beaches. They are the best to use in these situation.

2) Footages can be maximum 5 seconds long.

That is the ABSOLUTE maximum. 2-4 seconds is best. But NEVER cross 5 seconds.

It needs to be switching quickly for the video to not get boring.

What any new movie, you will see how quickly the scenes are changing.

Peoples attention spans are low and we want to hit them with NEW things, in this case new footages, ALL OF THE TIME.

If Tate keeps talking about a depressed person, just show different version of depressed people:
- A sad man
- A crying man
- A sad woman

And Alex' will show you how to make these searches live in the tutorial as well.

3) Follow the format

SWe will still use the superformat.

We still respect the placement zones.

We will still void having subtitles on peoples faces, even though they don't speak (just zoom into the footage to scale it correctly).

We will still use colour correction if possible.

Keep implementing all the stuff you learned, from music to superformat.

You can also still use motion tracking to track when a person is moving.

And you can still slowly zoom in when a footage is boring not much is happening.

Now,

You're ready to learn how to implement it directly. Alex' will teach you on the next slide.
