## How to find their content
We have a library with content coming soon, but for now I recommend you to use the brute force interview method.

Look for their name on Youtube, watch an interview or speech, and clip your favourite parts.

Otherwise, you could also look for:

"[CreatorName] Clips" on YouTube to find already clipped footage.
