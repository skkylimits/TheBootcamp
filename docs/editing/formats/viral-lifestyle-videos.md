# How To Create Viral Tate Lifestyle Videos (Senan)

As we know I have blown up several accounts to over 100K and one even over 1M Followers.

The Majority of the videos I used were Tate Lifestyle videos. I hardly see anyone else posting them and they‚Äôre very quick to make.

These Videos usually take less than 10 mins to make, and you can easily post 2 of these per day which is what I recommend.

They‚Äôre also extremely good for traffic and social proof.

Your Lifestyle vid must be unique, fast-paced, stimulating and attention grabbing

A Lifestyle Video is divided into 2 sections:
1) Build Up to the End Clip
2) End Clip Reveal

Your video should be no longer than 15 seconds preferably shorter

The goal like always is to get watch time as high as possible and for them to rewatch it, share it etc.

We do this by:

1. Having a Build up of 4-7 seconds to the Tate Lifestyle Clip at the End (Make sure they correlate well with the end clip and are high quality + entertaining)

2. You need an extremely clickbait title as the hook (exaggerate but do not lie), you can include emojis, have it play out for 3-5 seconds E.g (Tate Challenges Pet Tiger to Tug Of Warü•∂üî•)

3. Using Background Songs with Beat Drops and sync the drop with the revealing of the hook (for example if you had a video titled ‚ÄòInterior Of Tate‚Äôs $20M Jet‚Äô have the beat drop when you see the inside of the Jet)

4. Price Tags in the Hook are very effective E.g (Tate Buys New $500K McLaren)

5. Build more Intrigue with your caption (description) by hinting the clip at the End. If you were making a video about Tate‚Äôs Bugatti you could put (Tate‚Äôs INSANE BUGATTI at the END)

6. Reveal the end clip for 3-5 seconds. Make sure it is Extremely Attention Grabbing E.G (Showing Tate‚Äôs assistant getting in the Bugatti at the End)

## More Tips:

You should have multiple build up clips before the end clip and each should be 2-3 seconds max.

Your video + clickbait title has to be unique and stimulating enough for the viewer to stop and think ‚ÄúOh Shit, what‚Äôs this?‚Äù

Always post something that is completely new to the Algorithm, New Content will always outperform videos that have already been posted.

Use Capital Letters for some of the Words in your Hook to make it more attention grabbing

Have your video end shortly after the end clip is revealed so the viewer is forced to replay it. Replays will drive your video more viral.

Never have a clip where the camera is not moving, it is less interactive.

The emojis are super helpful in your hook and caption and need to be as bright and colourful as possible

Because my TikTok‚Äôs were all banned I can‚Äôt show you examples on there, however I‚Äôll show you 3 examples from my YT which all did very well

Note:
Remember to NOT mention 'Tate' in the hook. Replace 'Tate' with 'Cobra'.

Also make sure your hook is inside the placement zones and make it in the same style in which your normal hooks are to keep a consistent branding
