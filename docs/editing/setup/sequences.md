### What Video Size Should You Upload to TikTok

Currently the minimum settings required to upload to TikTok are:

1. MP4 or WebM video format
2. Choose 1080 x 1920 (720×1280 minimum resolution)
3. Maximum of 1 minutes

### Step 1: New Sequence

So now you have your horizontal or vertical footage, the first thing to do is create a new sequence, which you can do by pressing CTRL+N (or Command+N on the Mac).

</center>

In the new sequence dialogue box select Digital DSLR, then 1080p, and then select DSLR 1080p24.

Select the settings tab, where we need to alter the frame size to a vertical frame size setting.

</center>

We are essentially swapping the numbers, so 1080 for horizontal and 1920 for vertical, going from a 16:9 to 9:16 aspect ratio.

You can now save this preset for future use, which I highly recommend.

Title it something like ‘TikTok 9:16 1080×1920 23.976p’ so you can differentiate if you make a preset with 60p etc.

Click ok and then enter the sequence name and click ok again.
